Civbench!

Measuring the performance of different AI models on completing our civ homework. I was talking with one of my friends Jason and he mentioned that he has to save his sweet sweet GPT5 free responses to do the homework for him that got me wondering which models are actually the best at doing the homeworkSo I decided to make a simple benchwork benchmark. The benchmark gives the model the image of the question from the homework and then check its answers against Alan's answers, which I take to be ground truth then put a graph here of different models performance and yeah, and then a link to the github.
