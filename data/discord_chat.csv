"2025-09-20,00:11:46",songlai1320,#0,Wait I’m confused again… is the “strength” dependent on the yield stress? The ultimates stress? Or the force that if takes to reach the yield plateau? Or does it depend on the context?,mirageiiirz#0,
"2025-09-20,00:12:26",mirageiiirz,#0,latter,,
"2025-09-20,00:13:06",mirageiiirz,#0,strength usually refers to the stress but in a lack of context i could argue it could also mean force,,
"2025-09-20,00:13:13",mirageiiirz,#0,like this,,
"2025-09-20,00:13:37",songlai1320,#0,That’s why Bentz said to keep track of the notions… 😭,,
"2025-09-20,00:13:49",mirageiiirz,#0,what's the question,,
"2025-09-20,00:14:11",songlai1320,#0,Cuz in q6 b iii they’re asking for the strongest equivalent *spring*,,
"2025-09-20,00:14:27",songlai1320,#0,So I’m thinking of using the yielding strength multiplied by volume,,
"2025-09-20,00:14:42",songlai1320,#0,But carbon fibre doesn’t yield?,,

"2025-09-20,00:21:49",mirageiiirz,#0,how are you defining strong and tough here,,
"2025-09-20,00:23:39",songlai1320,#0,"Do we get to define that? 🥹 
I did F_{yield} as “strong” (since they’re springs… so only the linearly elastic behavior would count?) and “energy before breaking” as tough",,
"2025-09-20,00:24:43",mirageiiirz,#0,oh it's the strongest material for given dimensions,,
"2025-09-20,00:24:59",mirageiiirz,#0,well yeah there's really only one good definition,,
"2025-09-20,00:26:32",songlai1320,#0,"Ah ok
Thanks a bunch!",,
"2025-09-20,08:03:42",alanwang981,#0,highest k value,songlai1320#0,
"2025-09-20,10:19:36",songlai1320,#0,They have the same k value 🥹 and i think that’s what c is asking for? Thanks tho,,

"2025-09-25,23:54:05",.gharib,#0,i got 9.89 but i dont think that matches,,
"2025-09-25,23:54:11",.gharib,#0,also should we round up or down,,
"2025-09-25,23:54:15",.gharib,#0,and how tf do we do ci,,
"2025-09-25,23:55:55",alanwang981,#0,use the 3 equilibrium equations,,
"2025-09-26,00:04:24",alanwang981,#0,remember that roller only has vertical component,.gharib#0,
"2025-09-26,00:04:27",alanwang981,#0,no horizontal,,
"2025-09-26,19:48:54",vwrrwe,#0,"does c i) want the expressions to have variable ""h"" or ""n(number of storeys)""",,
"2025-09-26,19:51:10",alanwang981,#0,I used n,,
"2025-09-26,19:52:46",vwrrwe,#0,ok thx,alanwang981#0,
"2025-09-26,19:54:50",.gharib,#0,i used h/3.8 to make the units in meters,vwrrwe#0,
"2025-09-26,19:55:03",.gharib,#0,i felt like n didn’t make sense because all the units relate to height,,
"2025-09-26,19:56:51",alanwang981,#0,the previous questions asked for n,,
"2025-09-26,19:59:23",ab0kki,#0,h does make the equations nicer cubics for example,,
"2025-09-26,20:00:53",alanwang981,#0,"ngl, I dont think it matters",,
"2025-09-26,20:30:17",shyahaltyo,#0,true it says to round it anyways so i assumed we were gonna get shitty numbers,,
"2025-09-26,21:17:32",vwrrwe,#0,"It probablky doesnt matter. I think ""n"" would probably be the prefered case, because for ii), using ""n"" would have 1 less step. But ya, makes no difference",.gharib#0,
"2025-09-26,21:33:27",shyahaltyo,#0,yeah i did the variable as amount of storeys,,
"2025-09-26,21:33:45",shyahaltyo,#0,also we are allowed to digitally plot the graphs roght,,
"2025-09-26,21:33:52",shyahaltyo,#0,cuz i was not gpnna do that by hand,,
"2025-09-26,22:11:14",vwrrwe,#0,"probably, i di dit by hand - It was annoying",shyahaltyo#0,

"2025-09-27,14:16:13",alanwang981,#0,should be fine as long as you dont send your entire work,,
"2025-09-27,14:19:40",spicylemon._.,#0,"my thought was that more moment from By has to oppose the wind load for more stories, which would decrease Ay since they have to sum to the udls",,

"2025-09-27,14:20:25",alanwang981,#0,did you get that the roller force is 660n-4.57n^3?,,

"2025-09-27,22:43:10",shyahaltyo,#0,before it was like Fload/2 - 1/12h^3,,
"2025-09-28,16:07:54",inverted_badger_,#0,"I got these 

a) Load (kN) = 660n (where n = number of floors)

c)

i)
V_pin = 660n + 41.57n³ kN
R_roller = 660n - 41.57n³ kN

ii) n = 72 floors (R_roller is maximized at 72 floors)

iii) n = 145 floors (building starts to tip at 145 floors)

d) False. Doubling the height doubles the vertical reaction force but increases the wind reaction force by 8x, making the structure much more expensive than double to build safely.",,

if you are getting different answers as me, 2 things to note:
- on b and c, AR has a compression force, which means it points into the joints
- on d, I got that the rightmost length is 19.64. if you can prove me wrong pls do that",,

"2025-10-06,23:21:00",alanwang981,#0,nah our linalg tut is before cs lab,,
"2025-10-06,23:21:05",alanwang981,#0,we just finish cs lab in linalg tut,,
"2025-10-06,23:21:18",alanwang981,#0,and then go to the other cohort's cs lab to hand it in,,
"2025-10-06,23:21:21",alanwang981,#0,and go home early,,

"2025-10-07,07:02:19",shyahaltyo,#0,im guessing u calculate area of the hsses plus the rail so u can get the wind load,luyu_wu#0,
"2025-10-07,07:02:31",shyahaltyo,#0,so like m * kpa is newtons,,
"2025-10-07,07:02:46",shyahaltyo,#0,so on every joint use the tributary area,,
"2025-10-07,07:03:15",shyahaltyo,#0,but like im so confused for the bottom joints cuz like,,
"2025-10-07,07:03:33",shyahaltyo,#0,they have a rail over the hss,,
"2025-10-07,07:03:41",shyahaltyo,#0,so like does the arsa include the hss or not?,,
"2025-10-07,08:31:00",luyu_wu,#0,YA,shyahaltyo#0,
"2025-10-07,08:31:15",luyu_wu,#0,its so funny,,
"2025-10-07,08:58:06",shyahaltyo,#0,okay but how do calculate trhe area? did u just include the hss thats covered by the rail in the surface area,luyu_wu#0,

"2025-10-12,20:26:26",pungyosaurus,#0,why tho,alanwang981#0,
"2025-10-12,20:27:00",pungyosaurus,#0,i thought that the braces arent the horizontal members,,
"2025-10-12,20:28:16",alanwang981,#0,hmmm,pungyosaurus#0,
"2025-10-12,20:28:24",alanwang981,#0,that I'm actually not sure about,,
"2025-10-12,20:28:30",pungyosaurus,#0,cuz in the note,,
"2025-10-12,20:28:35",pungyosaurus,#0,it tells us to ignore the horizontal members,,
"2025-10-12,20:28:43",luyu_wu,#0,oh wait thats fr,,
"2025-10-12,20:28:51",pungyosaurus,#0,except someone said theres a typo,,
"2025-10-12,20:29:00",luyu_wu,#0,the horizontal member dimensions are alr defined in b and c,,
"2025-10-12,20:29:02",luyu_wu,#0,🤔,,
"2025-10-12,20:29:06",pungyosaurus,#0,ye exactly,luyu_wu#0,
"2025-10-12,20:29:12",pungyosaurus,#0,we are like double counting if we reassign,,
"2025-10-12,20:29:19",alanwang981,#0,are they the same members?,,
"2025-10-12,20:29:26",alanwang981,#0,also if thats the case the bridge is not safe,,
"2025-10-12,20:29:41",pungyosaurus,#0,does the fos save us,,
"2025-10-12,20:29:48",alanwang981,#0,yes but,,
"2025-10-12,20:29:51",alanwang981,#0,it's not very safe,,
"2025-10-12,20:29:56",draco_lactens,#0,exactly,,
"2025-10-12,20:30:06",pungyosaurus,#0,safe is safse,,
"2025-10-12,20:30:22",luyu_wu,#0,oops gotta change answers for F then 🫡,,
"2025-10-12,20:30:23",draco_lactens,#0,the first part doesn't count the wind so the original hss can't withstabd wind,,
"2025-10-12,20:30:38",luyu_wu,#0,gg,alanwang981#0,
"2025-10-12,20:31:26",luyu_wu,#0,this has to be the assignment w the most inconsistencies so far 😃,,
"2025-10-12,20:33:24",draco_lactens,#0,yeah,,
"2025-10-12,20:34:01",draco_lactens,#0,so are we changing it,,
"2025-10-12,20:34:38",pungyosaurus,#0,i think whatever we change it ot,,
"2025-10-12,20:34:43",pungyosaurus,#0,we have ot justify it with a note,,
"2025-10-12,20:34:51",draco_lactens,#0,fk it im putting both down,,
"2025-10-12,20:34:56",pungyosaurus,#0,cuz they said they will accept multiple answers,,
"2025-10-12,20:39:06",.gharib,#0,dont we have to consider only,,
"2025-10-12,20:39:09",.gharib,#0,vertical/diagonal,,
"2025-10-12,20:39:16",.gharib,#0,since question said solving for horizontal isnt needed,,
"2025-10-12,20:39:19",.gharib,#0,so the fdemand would change,,
"2025-10-12,20:55:13",draco_lactens,#0,oh shit,,
"2025-10-12,20:55:18",draco_lactens,#0,that's what that meant?,,

"2025-10-12,21:01:14",draco_lactens,#0,"im so confused, what's stopping us from taking 89x89x42",,
"2025-10-12,21:26:46",spicylemon._.,#0,Bro i just forgor the 12kN load and messed up in the exact same spot,alanwang981#0,
"2025-10-12,21:28:30",alanwang981,#0,SAME LMAO,,
"2025-10-12,21:28:37",alanwang981,#0,I FORGOR THE 12kN LOAD,,
"2025-10-12,21:54:50",draco_lactens,#0,same,,
"2025-10-12,22:19:38",sean_heehee,#0,wtf why is everyone getting different answers,,
"2025-10-12,22:20:06",sean_heehee,#0,isnt the largest compression force just 35.9 kN so you end up with an HSS of like 102x102x4.8,,
"2025-10-12,22:21:03",anoddapple,#0,for wind loads all braces will endure both tension and compression,,
"2025-10-12,22:21:14",anoddapple,#0,so you just take the max force,,
"2025-10-12,22:21:17",sean_heehee,#0,oh real i forgot they said that,,
"2025-10-12,22:21:19",sean_heehee,#0,truth nuke,,
"2025-10-12,22:25:44",alanwang981,#0,wait what,anoddapple#0,
"2025-10-12,22:26:13",sean_heehee,#0,it says that wind forces can go in either direction,,
"2025-10-12,22:26:20",alanwang981,#0,💀,,
"2025-10-12,22:26:27",sean_heehee,#0,so you need to account for it in your HSS,,
"2025-10-12,22:29:21",spicylemon._.,#0,This only changes things for the bottom bracing right,sean_heehee#0,
"2025-10-12,22:30:10",sean_heehee,#0,yeah i think so forces in the top bracing are too small,,
"2025-10-12,22:42:42",spicylemon._.,#0,No i mean wind reversing only might complicate the answer for bottom bracing,,
"2025-10-12,22:43:00",spicylemon._.,#0,Because top one has that symmetry,,

"2025-10-31,17:31:17",bear_real,#0,i think the 21.5 would be the change in moment from x=0.5 to x=3.0. so if M(0.5) = 0.239 then M(3.0) = M(0.5) + 21.5 = 0.239 + 21.5 = 21.7 ish,alanwang981#0,
