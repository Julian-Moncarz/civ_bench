  "answer": "Of course. As a dedicated civil engineering student, I will provide a detailed and step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### **Analysis of Truss Geometry and Loads**\n\nFirst, let's establish a clear coordinate system and identify the locations of all joints and loads. Let the pin support at **R** be the origin (0, 0).\n\n*   **Coordinate System:** Origin at R (0, 0). The positive x-axis points to the right, and the positive y-axis points upwards.\n*   **Support & Joint Coordinates:**\n    *   R = (0, 0)\n    *   From the diagram, member AR is vertical and has a total height of 93.0 m. So, **A = (0, 93.0)**.\n    *   The horizontal centerline (J-K-L-M-N-O-P) is located 49.4 m above R. So, all joints on this line have a y-coordinate of 49.4 m.\n    *   The horizontal panel lengths are given along the top chord.\n    *   x-coordinates of the vertical members:\n        *   A, R: x = 0\n        *   B, J, S: x = 25.5 m\n        *   C, K, T: x = 25.5 + 25.5 = 51.0 m\n        *   D, L, U: x = 51.0 + 25.5 = 76.5 m\n        *   E, M, V: x = 76.5 + 25.5 = 102.0 m\n        *   F, N, W: x = 102.0 + 22.4 = ",
