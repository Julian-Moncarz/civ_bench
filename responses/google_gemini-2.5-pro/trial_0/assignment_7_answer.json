Here is a detailed step-by-step solution to the assignment, as would be prepared by a top engineering student.\n\n### **Initial Data and Properties Calculation**\n\nFirst, let's summarize the given information and calculate the necessary properties for the steel beams.\n\n**Given Data:**\n*   Beam Material: Hot-rolled steel\n*   Yield Stress (\u03c3_y): 400 MPa (400 N/mm\u00b2)\n*   Beam Mass (m): 1,168 kg\n*   Beam Total Length (L): 0.5 m + 2.5 m + 2.5 m + 0.5 m = 6.0 m\n*   Jack Force for Straightening (Pj): 22 kN\n*   Number of cable loops: 5 at each end (meaning 10 cable strands carry the load at each end)\n*   Cross-section dimensions (from Fig. 2):\n    *   Overall depth (h): 622 mm\n    *   Flange width (b_f): 327 mm\n    *   Flange thickness (t_f): 24 mm\n    *   Web thickness (t_w): 15.4 mm\n\n**1. Distributed Load (Self-Weight):**\nThe mass of each beam is uniformly distributed. The distributed load `w` is:\n*   Weight (W) = m \u00d7 g = 1,168 kg \u00d7 9.81 m/s\u00b2 = 11,458 N = 11.46 kN\n*   Distributed load (w) = W / L = 11.46 kN / 6.0 m = **1.91 kN/m**\n\n**2. Cross-Sectional Properties:**\nWe calculate the second moment of area (I) and the section modulus (S) for the I-beam cross-section. The neutral axis (N.A.) is at the geometric center due to symmetry.\n*   Distance from N.A. to extreme fiber (c) = h / 2 = 622 mm / 2 = 311 mm\n*   Second Moment of Area (I): We use the method of subtracting the void areas from the overall rectangular area.\n    *   I_total_rectangle = (1/12) * b_f * h\u00b3 = (1/12) * (327 mm) * (622 mm)\u00b3 = 6.577 \u00d7 10\u2079 mm\u2074\n    *   Void width = b_f - t_w = 327 - 15.4 = 311.6 mm (this is the combined width of the two void rectangles)\n    *   Void height = h - 2*t_f = 622 - 2*(24) = 574 mm\n    *   I_voids = (1/12) * (void width) * (void height)\u00b3 = (1/12) * (311.6 mm) * (574 mm)\u00b3 = 4.918 \u00d7 10\u2079 mm\u2074\n    *   I = I_total_rectangle - I_voids = (6.577 - 4.918) \u00d7 10\u2079 mm\u2074 = **1.659 \u00d7 10\u2079 mm\u2074**\n*   Section Modulus (S):\n    *   S = I / c = (1.659 \u00d7 10\u2079 mm\u2074) / (311 mm) = **5.334 \u00d7 10\u2076 mm\u00b3**\n\n---\n\n### **Question a: Bending Moment Diagram for the Top Beam**\n\nFor this part, the top beam DAE is straight. The jack applies an upward force Pj = 22 kN, and the cables at D and E apply downward tensile forces.\n\n**1. Free-Body Diagram (FBD) of Top Beam DAE:**\nThe beam is subjected to an upward force Pj at the center (A), downward cable forces T at each end (D and E), and its own distributed weight `w`.\n\n\n**2. Calculate Cable Forces (T):**\nBy vertical equilibrium (\u03a3F_y = 0):\nPj - T_D - T_E - w*L = 0\nBy symmetry, T_D = T_E = T.\n22 kN - 2*T - (1.91 kN/m * 6.0 m) = 0\n22 kN - 2*T - 11.46 kN = 0\n2*T = 10.54 kN\n**T = 5.27 kN**\n\n**3. Bending Moment Calculation:**\nThe maximum bending moment will occur at the center (point A) where the shear is zero (due to symmetry). Let's calculate the moment at A by considering the left half of the beam (from D to A).\nM_A = -T * (L/2) + M_from_UDL\nThe moment at the center of a simply supported beam due to a UDL is -wL\u00b2/8.\nM_A = - (Moment from T) - (Moment from w)\nMoment from end force T acting over length L/2: -T * (L/2) = -5.27 kN * 3.0 m = -15.81 kN\u00b7m\nMoment contribution at the center from the UDL on the half-span DA: -(w * (L/2)) * (L/4) = - (1.91 * 3) * 1.5 = -8.595 kN\u00b7m\nM_A = -15.81 - 8.595 = -24.405 kN\u00b7m\nRounding to one decimal place, **M_A = -24.4 kN\u00b7m**.\n\n**4. Sketch Bending Moment Diagram (BMD):**\nThe diagram is parabolic due to the uniformly distributed load. It starts at M=0 at the ends (D and E) and reaches a maximum negative value at the center (A).\n\n\n\n---\n\n### **Question b: Maximum Jack Force (Pj,max) and Minimum Cable Diameter (d_min)**\n\nHere, the jack force is increased until yielding is about to occur in either the beams or the cables. We must find which component is the limiting factor.\n\n**Hint: Draw two free-body diagrams!**\n\n**1. Free-Body Diagrams (FBDs):**\nLet Pj,max be the maximum jack force and T_max be the corresponding total cable tension at each end.\n*   **FBD of Top Beam (DAE):** Experiences an upward force Pj,max, downward tension T_max at each end, and downward self-weight w. A large Pj,max will cause it to bend concave up (positive moment).\n*   **FBD of Bottom Beam:** Experiences a downward force Pj,max, upward tension T_max at each end, upward support reactions R at each end, and downward self-weight w. It will bend concave down (negative moment).\n\n\n\n**2. Relate Forces and Find Critical Beam:**\nFirst, let's find the support reactions `R` by considering the entire system. The jack and cable forces are internal.\n\u03a3F_y (System) = R + R - w*L (top) - w*L (bottom) = 0\n2R - 2 * (11.46 kN) = 0  =>  **R = 11.46 kN**\nThe support reactions are constant and independent of the jack force.\n\nNow, from the FBD of the top beam, by vertical equilibrium:\nPj,max - 2*T_max - w*L = 0  =>  Pj,max - 2*T_max - 11.46 = 0  => **T_max = (Pj,max - 11.46) / 2**\n\n**3. Maximum Moment in Each Beam:**\nThe maximum moment for both beams will be at their center.\n*   **Top Beam (DAE):** The maximum positive moment at A is caused by the upward `Pj,max` and offset by the downward `w`. Using superposition for a simply supported beam:\n    M_max,top = (Pj,max * L / 4) - (w * L\u00b2 / 8)\n    M_max,top = (Pj,max * 6 / 4) - (1.91 * 6\u00b2 / 8) = **1.5 * Pj,max - 8.595** (in kN\u00b7m)\n\n*   **Bottom Beam:** This beam is supported at its ends by (R + T_max) and loaded downwards by `Pj,max` and `w`. The maximum negative moment at its center is:\n    M_max,bottom = - (Pj,max * L / 4) - (w * L\u00b2 / 8)\n    M_max,bottom = - (Pj,max * 6 / 4) - (1.91 * 6\u00b2 / 8) = **-1.5 * Pj,max - 8.595** (in kN\u00b7m)\n\nComparing the magnitudes:\n|M_max,bottom| = 1.5 * Pj,max + 8.595\n|M_max,top| = |1.5 * Pj,max - 8.595|\nFor any Pj,max > 0, **|M_max,bottom| > |M_max,top|**. Therefore, the **bottom beam is the critical member and will yield first.**\n\n**4. Calculate Pj,max:**\nYielding occurs when the maximum flexural stress reaches the yield stress.\n\u03c3_max = M_allowable / S  =>  M_allowable = \u03c3_y * S\nM_allowable = (400 N/mm\u00b2) * (5.334 \u00d7 10\u2076 mm\u00b3) = 2133.6 \u00d7 10\u2076 N\u00b7mm = **2133.6 kN\u00b7m**\n\nSet the magnitude of the maximum moment in the bottom beam equal to the allowable moment:\n|M_max,bottom| = M_allowable\n1.5 * Pj,max + 8.595 = 2133.6\n1.5 * Pj,max = 2125.005\n**Pj,max = 1416.7 kN**\n\n**5. Calculate d_min:**\nThe minimum cable diameter `d_min` is the diameter required to withstand the tension generated by `Pj,max` without yielding.\nFirst, find the total cable tension `T_max`:\nT_max = (Pj,max - 11.46) / 2 = (1416.7 - 11.46) / 2 = **702.6 kN**\n\nThis tension is carried by 10 cable strands.\nForce per strand (P_strand) = T_max / 10 = 702.6 kN / 10 = 70.26 kN = 70,260 N\n\nThe stress in the cable should not exceed the yield stress (assuming the cable steel has the same \u03c3_y = 400 MPa).\n\u03c3_cable = P_strand / A_strand \u2264 \u03c3_y\nA_min = P_strand / \u03c3_y = 70,260 N / 400 N/mm\u00b2 = **175.65 mm\u00b2**\n\nNow, find the diameter `d_min` from this minimum area.\nA_min = \u03c0 * (d_min)\u00b2 / 4\n175.65 mm\u00b2 = \u03c0 * (d_min)\u00b2 / 4\nd_min\u00b2 = (175.65 * 4) / \u03c0 = 223.68 mm\u00b2\n**d_min = 14.96 mm**\n\n**Answers:**\n*   Maximum allowable jack force, **Pj,max = 1417 kN**\n*   Minimum allowable cable diameter, **d_min = 15.0 mm**\n\n---\n\n### **Question c: Maximum Flexural Stress in Each Beam**\n\nCalculate the maximum flexural stress in each beam when the jack force is Pj,max = 1416.7 kN.\n\n**1. Bottom Beam:**\nBy definition, we calculated `Pj,max` based on the condition that the bottom beam is at the point of yielding. Therefore, its maximum flexural stress is the yield stress.\n**\u03c3_max,bottom = 400 MPa**\n\n*Verification:*\nM_max,bottom = -1.5 * Pj,max - 8.595 = -1.5 * (1416.7) - 8.595 = -2125.05 - 8.595 = -2133.6 kN\u00b7m\n\u03c3_max,bottom = |M_max,bottom| / S = (2133.6 \u00d7 10\u00b3 N\u00b7m) / (5.334 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 m\u00b3) = 400.0 \u00d7 10\u2076 Pa = **400 MPa**.\n\n**2. Top Beam:**\nFirst, calculate the maximum moment in the top beam using `Pj,max`.\nM_max,top = 1.5 * Pj,max - 8.595 = 1.5 * (1416.7) - 8.595 = 2125.05 - 8.595 = **2116.5 kN\u00b7m**\n\nNow",
