  "answer": "Here is a step-by-step solution to the questions.\n\nFirst, let's establish the key parameters and properties given in the problem statement.\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   Yield stress of steel (beams and cables), \u03c3_y = 400 MPa\n*   Beam mass, m = 1,168 kg\n*   Beam length, L = 0.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 0.5 = 6.0 m\n*   Number of cable loops = 5 (This means 10 parallel cable strands support the load at each end)\n*   Initial jack force to straighten beam, P_j_initial = 22 kN\n*   Gravitational acceleration, g = 9.81 m/s\u00b2\n\n**Initial Calculations:**\n\n1.  **Distributed Load (Self-Weight of Beam):**\n    Each beam has a uniformly distributed self-weight, `w`.\n    Weight = m \u00d7 g = 1,168 kg \u00d7 9.81 m/s\u00b2 = 11,458 N = 11.46 kN\n    w = Weight / L = 11.46 kN / 6.0 m = 1.91 kN/m\n\n2.  **Cross-Sectional Properties:**\n    We need to calculate the moment of inertia (I) and the section modulus (S) for the I-beam cross-section shown in Figure 2. The neutral axis (NA) is at the center of the beam due to symmetry.\n    *   Total depth, h = 622 mm\n    *   Distance from NA to extreme fiber, c = h / 2 = 311 mm\n    *   Flange width, b_f = 327 mm\n    *   Flange thickness, t_f = 24 mm\n    *   Web thickness, t_w = 15.4 mm\n    *   Web height, h_w = h - 2*t_f = 622 - 2(24) = 574 mm\n\n    We calculate the moment of inertia `I` using the parallel axis theorem, treating the cross-section as a large rectangle minus two smaller rectangles, or as three separate rectangles (two flanges and one web). Using the web + two flanges method:\n\n    *   **I_web** (centroid is on the NA):\n        I_web = (1/12) * t_w * h_w\u00b3 = (1/12) * (15.4 mm) * (574 mm)\u00b3 = 242.54 \u00d7 10\u2076 mm\u2074\n    *   **I_flanges** (using parallel axis theorem):\n        The distance `d` from the centroid of each flange to the NA is: d = (h/2) - (t_f/2) = 311 - 12 = 299 mm.\n        Area of one flange, A_f = b_f * t_f = 327 mm * 24 mm = 7,848 mm\u00b2.\n        I for one flange = I_c + A_f * d\u00b2 = [(1/12)*b_f*t_f\u00b3] + A_f*d\u00b2\n        I_one_flange = [(1/12)*327*24\u00b3] + (7848 * 299\u00b2) = 0.377\u00d710\u2076 + 702.68\u00d710\u2076 = 703.06\u00d710\u2076 mm\u2074\n    *   **Total I:**\n        I_total = I_web + 2 * I_one_flange = 242.54\u00d710\u2076 + 2 * (703.06\u00d710\u2076) = 1,648.66 \u00d7 10\u2076 mm\u2074\n        I_total \u2248 1.649 \u00d7 10\u2079 mm\u2074 = 1.649 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 m\u2074\n\n    *   **Section Modulus (S):**\n        S = I_total / c = (1.6487 \u00d7 10\u2079 mm\u2074) / 311 mm = 5.30 \u00d7 10\u2076 mm\u00b3 = 5.30 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 m\u00b3\n\n### **Question a.**\n\n**Goal:** Sketch the bending moment diagram (BMD) for the top beam (DAE) when it is straight, using the given P_j = 22 kN.\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe question states that the jack \"pushes upon each beam\". This implies the jack pushes the beams apart. However, to straighten an initially sagging beam, the loading must create a positive (concave up) moment. This is achieved by pulling the center down and pushing the ends up.\nLet's analyze the FBD as shown: The jack PULLS the beams together, and the cables support them.\n*   **FBD of Top Beam (DAE):**\n    *   Downward jack force at the center: P_j = 22 kN\n    *   Upward cable forces at 0.5 m from each end: F_cable\n    *   Downward uniformly distributed self-weight: w = 1.91 kN/m\n\n*   **Equilibrium:** The beam is symmetric, so the two cable forces are equal.\n    \u03a3F_y = 0:   2 * F_cable - P_j - (w * L) = 0\n    2 * F_cable - 22 kN - (1.91 kN/m * 6.0 m) = 0\n    2 * F_cable - 22 kN - 11.46 kN = 0\n    2 * F_cable = 33.46 kN   =>   F_cable = 16.73 kN\n\n*   **Bending Moment Calculation:**\n    *   **Moment at the cable support (x = 0.5 m):** Caused by the overhang.\n        M(0.5) = - (w * 0.5 m) * (0.5 m / 2) = - (1.91 * 0.5) * 0.25 = -0.24 kN\u00b7m\n    *   **Moment at the center (x = 3.0 m):**\n        We can find the moment at the center by considering the left half of the beam and summing moments about the center.\n        M_center = F_cable * (2.5 m) - (w * 3.0 m) * (3.0 m / 2)\n        M_center = 16.73 kN * 2.5 m - (1.91 kN/m * 3.0 m) * 1.5 m\n        M_center = 41.825 kN\u00b7m - 8.595 kN\u00b7m = 33.23 kN\u00b7m\n\n**Sketch of Bending Moment Diagram (BMD):**\nThe BMD is sketched below.\n*   Starts at 0 at x=0.\n*   Curves down parabolically to **-0.24 kN\u00b7m** at the cable support (x = 0.5 m).\n*   Curves up parabolically to a maximum positive moment of **+33.23 kN\u00b7m** at the center (x = 3.0 m).\n*   The diagram is symmetric, returning to -0.24 kN\u00b7m at x = 5.5 m and 0 at x = 6.0 m.\n\n\n\n---\n\n### **Question b.**\n\n**Goal:** Determine the maximum allowable jack force, P_j,max, and the minimum allowable cable diameter, d_min, to prevent yielding in either beam or the cables.\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe problem text \"deforms into a curve again, now concave up\" and the physical action of straightening a sagging beam imply the jack pushes the beams apart, creating a positive moment.\n*   **FBD of Top Beam:** Jack force P_j is UP, cable forces F_cable are DOWN, weight w is DOWN.\n    Equilibrium (\u03a3F_y=0): P_j - 2*F_cable - w*L = 0  =>  **F_cable = (P_j - 11.46) / 2**\n*   **FBD of Bottom Beam:** Jack force P_j is DOWN, cable forces F_cable are UP, support reactions R are UP at the very ends, weight w is DOWN.\n    Equilibrium (\u03a3F_y=0): 2*R + 2*F_cable - P_j - w*L = 0. Substituting F_cable we find R=11.46 kN.\n\n**Maximum Bending Moments:**\n*   **Maximum Moment in Top Beam (M_top,max):**\n    Occurs at the center (x=3.0 m). We sum moments about the center for the left half. The internal moment must resist the external moments.\n    M_top,max = F_cable * 2.5 m + (Moment of w on left half)\n    M_top,max = F_cable * 2.5 + (w*3.0)*1.5 = 2.5*F_cable + 8.595\n    Substitute F_cable = (P_j - 11.46)/2:\n    M_top,max = 2.5 * [(P_j - 11.46)/2] + 8.595 = 1.25*(P_j - 11.46) + 8.595\n    **M_top,max = 1.25 * P_j - 5.73 (kN\u00b7m)**\n\n*   **Maximum Moment in Bottom Beam (M_bot,max):**\n    Occurs at the center. Sum moments about the center for the left half. Upward reaction R=11.46 kN at x=0, upward force F_cable at x=0.5.\n    M_bot,max = R*3.0 + F_cable*2.5 - (Moment of w on left half)\n    M_bot,max = 11.46 * 3.0 + F_cable * 2.5 - (w*3.0)*1.5\n    M_bot,max = 34.38 + 2.5*F_cable - 8.595 = 25.785 + 2.5*F_cable\n    Substitute F_cable = (P_j - 11.46)/2:\n    M_bot,max = 25.785 + 2.5 * [(P_j - 11.46)/2] = 25.785 + 1.25*(P_j - 11.46)\n    **M_bot,max = 1.25 * P_j + 11.46 (kN\u00b7m)**\n\n**Determine Limiting Component:**\nThe allowable moment before yielding is M_allowable = S \u00d7 \u03c3_y.\nM_allowable = (5.30 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 m\u00b3) \u00d7 (400 \u00d7 10\u00b3 kN/m\u00b2) = 2120 kN\u00b7m\n\nFor any P_j > 0, M_bot,max > M_top,max. Therefore, the **bottom beam will yield first**. We find P_j,max by setting M_bot,max equal to M_allowable.\n\n1.  **Find P_j,max:**\n    M_bot,max = 1.25 * P_j,max + 11.46 = 2120 kN\u00b7m\n    1.25 * P_j,max = 2120 - 11.46 = 2108.54\n    **P_j,max = 1686.8 kN**\n\n2.  **Find d_min:**\n    Now use P_j,max to find the required cable diameter.\n    First, find the total cable force `F_cable` at this jack force.\n    F_cable = (P_j,max - 11.46) / 2 = (1686.8 - 11.46) / 2 = 837.67 kN\n\n    This total force is shared among 10 cable strands (5 loops \u00d7 2 strands/loop).\n    Tension per strand, T_strand = F_cable / 10 = 83.767 kN = 83,767 N\n\n    The stress in the cable must not exceed the yield stress (400 MPa).\n    \u03c3_cable = T_strand / A_cable \u2264 \u03c3_y\n    A_cable = \u03c0/4 * d_min\u00b2\n    83,767 N / (\u03c0/4 * d_min\u00b2) \u2264 400 N/mm\u00b2\n    d_min\u00b2 \u2265 (83,767 * 4) / (400 * \u03c0)\n    d_min\u00b2 \u2265 266.6 mm\u00b2\n    **d_min \u2265 16.33 mm**\n\n**Answers for (b):**\n*   The maximum allowable jack force is **P_j,max = 1687 kN**.\n*   The minimum allowable cable diameter is **d_min = 16.3 mm**.\n\n---\n\n### **Question c.**\n\n**Goal:** Calculate the maximum flexural stress in each beam based on P_j,max found in part (b).\n\n**Analysis:**\nWe use P_j,max = 1686.8 kN and the moment expressions from part (b).\n\n1.  **Maximum Flexural Stress in the Bottom Beam (\u03c3_bot,max):**\n    We found P_j,max by setting the stress in the bottom beam to its yield limit. Therefore, the maximum flexural stress is the yield stress.\n    **\u03c3_bot,max = 400 MPa**\n\n    *Verification (Optional):*\n    M_bot,max = 1.25 * (1686.8) + 11.46 = 2108.5 + 11.46 = 2120 kN\u00b7m\n    \u03c3_bot,max = M_bot,max / S = (2120 kN\u00b7m) / (5.30 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 m\u00b3) = 400,000 kN/m\u00b2 = 400 MPa.\n\n2.  **Maximum Flexural Stress in the Top Beam (\u03c3_top,max):**\n    First, calculate the maximum moment in the top beam using P_j,max.\n    M_top,max = 1.25 * P_j,max - 5.73\n    M_top,max = 1.25 * (1686.8) - 5.73 = 2108.5 - 5.73 = 2102.77 kN\u00b7m\n\n    Now, calculate the resulting flexural stress.\n    \u03c3_top,max = M_top,max / S\n    \u03c3_top,max = (2102.77 kN\u00b7m) / (5.30 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b3 m\u00b3) = 396,750 kN/m\u00b2 = 396.8 MPa.\n\n**Answers for (c):**\n*   Maximum flexural stress in the **bottom beam** is **400 MPa**.\n*   Maximum flexural stress in the **top beam** is **397 MPa**.",
