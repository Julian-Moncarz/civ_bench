  "answer": "Of course. As a dedicated civil engineering student, I will provide a detailed solution to this mechanics of materials problem.\n\n### **Initial Setup and Material Properties**\n\nFirst, let's list the given parameters and derive some basic properties.\n\n**Given:**\n*   Length of wire, L = 2,500 mm = 2.5 m\n*   Diameter of wire, d = 6 mm = 0.006 m\n*   Mass of dropped object, m = 4 kg\n*   Rupture strain, \u03b5_r = 0.25 mm/mm = 0.25\n*   Acceleration due to gravity, g = 9.81 m/s\u00b2\n\n**Calculated Properties:**\n*   Cross-sectional area of the wire, A:\n    A = \u03c0 * (d/2)\u00b2 = \u03c0 * (0.003 m)\u00b2 \u2248 2.8274 x 10\u207b\u2075 m\u00b2\n*   Weight of the dropped mass, W:\n    W = m * g = 4 kg * 9.81 m/s\u00b2 = 39.24 N\n\n**Assumed Material Properties for Low Alloy Steel:**\nThe problem specifies \"low alloy steel\" but does not provide its mechanical properties. We will use typical values for a common grade of low alloy steel. These assumptions are crucial for the numerical calculations.\n*   **Young's Modulus (Modulus of Elasticity), E:**\n    E = 210 GPa = 210 x 10\u2079 N/m\u00b2\n*   **Yield Strength, \u03c3_y:**\n    \u03c3_y = 500 MPa = 500 x 10\u2076 N/m\u00b2\n\n---\n\n### **Question 3a:**\n\n**What is the impact velocity of the dropped mass just before it hits the catch plate, expressed as an algebraic expression?**\n\n**Reasoning:**\nWe can find the impact velocity using the principle of conservation of energy. As the mass falls a height *h*, its initial potential energy (PE) is converted into kinetic energy (KE). We neglect air resistance.\n\n*   Potential Energy at height *h*: PE = mgh\n*   Kinetic Energy at impact: KE = (1/2)mv\u00b2\n\nSetting PE = KE:\nmgh = (1/2)mv\u00b2\n\n**Answer:**\nSolving for the velocity, v:\nv\u00b2 = 2gh\n**v = \u221a(2gh)**\n\n---\n\n### **Question 3b:**\n\n**What is the maximum value of *h* which does not cause any permanent deformations in the wire?**\n\n**Reasoning:**\nFor the wire to have no permanent deformation, the maximum stress experienced (\u03c3_max) must not exceed the yield strength (\u03c3_y). The limiting case is when \u03c3_max = \u03c3_y.\n\nWe use the work-energy principle. The total potential energy lost by the mass is equal to the maximum strain energy absorbed by the wire. The mass falls a total distance of (h + \u03b4_max), where \u03b4_max is the maximum extension of the wire.\n\n*   Loss in Potential Energy (\u0394PE) = W * (h + \u03b4_max) = mg(h + \u03b4_max)\n*   Strain Energy (U_max) in the elastic range = (1/2) * P_max * \u03b4_max\n\nAt the elastic limit:\n*   Maximum force, P_max = P_y = \u03c3_y * A\n*   Maximum elastic extension, \u03b4_max = \u03b4_y = (\u03c3_y * L) / E\n\nSetting \u0394PE = U_max:\nmg(h_max + \u03b4_y) = (1/2) * P_y * \u03b4_y\n\n**Calculations:**\n1.  Calculate the yield force (P_y) and yield extension (\u03b4_y):\n    P_y = \u03c3_y * A = (500 x 10\u2076 N/m\u00b2) * (2.8274 x 10\u207b\u2075 m\u00b2) = 14,137 N\n    \u03b4_y = (\u03c3_y * L) / E = (500 x 10\u2076 N/m\u00b2 * 2.5 m) / (210 x 10\u2079 N/m\u00b2) \u2248 0.005952 m\n\n2.  Substitute these values into the energy equation to solve for h_max:\n    39.24 N * (h_max + 0.005952 m) = (1/2) * (14,137 N) * (0.005952 m)\n    39.24 * (h_max + 0.005952) = 42.08\n    h_max + 0.005952 = 42.08 / 39.24\n    h_max + 0.005952 = 1.0724\n    h_max = 1.0724 - 0.005952 = 1.06648 m\n\n**Answer:**\nThe maximum value of *h* which does not cause permanent deformation is **1.066 m**.\n\n---\n\n### **Pre-analysis for Parts c, d, e:**\nFor the following parts, h = 2.2 m. Since h = 2.2 m > h_max = 1.066 m, the impact **will cause the wire to yield** and undergo plastic deformation. We must use an elastic-perfectly plastic model, as strain-hardening is neglected.\n\n### **Question 3d:**\n\n**If h = 2.2 m, calculate the maximum extension of the wire caused by the weight landing on the catch-plate.**\n*(Note: It is easier to solve for extension first, as it is needed to determine the maximum force.)*\n\n**Reasoning:**\nSince yielding occurs, the energy absorbed by the wire is the area under the elastic-perfectly plastic force-deflection curve. This consists of an elastic part (a triangle) and a plastic part (a rectangle).\n\n*   Loss in Potential Energy (\u0394PE) = mg(h + \u03b4_max)\n*   Strain Energy (U_max) for plastic deformation = (Area under Force-Deflection Curve)\n    U_max = (1/2)P_y*\u03b4_y + P_y*(\u03b4_max - \u03b4_y) = P_y * (\u03b4_max - \u03b4_y/2)\n\nEquating energy:\nmg(h + \u03b4_max) = P_y * (\u03b4_max - \u03b4_y/2)\n\n**Calculations:**\nWe have h = 2.2 m, and from part b, P_y = 14,137 N and \u03b4_y = 0.005952 m.\n39.24 * (2.2 + \u03b4_max) = 14,137 * (\u03b4_max - 0.005952 / 2)\n86.328 + 39.24 * \u03b4_max = 14,137 * \u03b4_max - 14,137 * (0.002976)\n86.328 + 39.24 * \u03b4_max = 14,137 * \u03b4_max - 42.08\n86.328 + 42.08 = 14,137 * \u03b4_max - 39.24 * \u03b4_max\n128.408 = (14,137 - 39.24) * \u03b4_max\n128.408 = 14,097.76 * \u03b4_max\n\u03b4_max = 128.408 / 14,097.76 \u2248 0.009108 m\n\n**Answer:**\nThe maximum extension of the wire is **9.11 mm**.\n\n---\n\n### **Question 3c:**\n\n**If h = 2.2 m, what is the maximum force experienced by the wire at any point during the drop?**\n\n**Reasoning:**\nAs determined previously, the drop from h = 2.2 m causes the wire to yield. In an elastic-perfectly plastic material model (where strain hardening is neglected), once the material yields, it continues to deform at a constant stress (the yield stress). Therefore, the force in the wire cannot exceed the yield force.\n\n**Calculations:**\nThe maximum force is the yield force, P_y.\nP_max = P_y = \u03c3_y * A = 14,137 N\n\n**Answer:**\nThe maximum force experienced by the wire is **14,137 N** (or 14.14 kN).\n\n---\n\n### **Question 3e:**\n\n**If the mass is repeatedly dropped from a height of h = 2.2 m, then the wire will eventually rupture. How many drops can the wire sustain before rupturing?**\n\n**Reasoning:**\nEach drop from h = 2.2 m causes a certain amount of permanent (plastic) deformation. The wire will rupture when the total accumulated extension reaches the rupture extension. We assume the energy input for each drop is the same.\n\n1.  **Permanent extension per drop (\u03b4_p):**\n    After reaching maximum extension (\u03b4_max), the wire unloads elastically. The amount of elastic recovery (\u03b4_recovery) is equal to the extension at the yield point (\u03b4_y).\n    \u03b4_p = \u03b4_max - \u03b4_recovery = \u03b4_max - \u03b4_y\n\n2.  **Total extension at rupture (\u03b4_rupture):**\n    This is determined by the rupture strain (\u03b5_r).\n    \u03b4_rupture = \u03b5_r * L\n\n3.  **Number of drops (N):**\n    The wire can sustain N drops until the total accumulated permanent deformation equals the total plastic extension capacity of the wire. The total plastic extension capacity is the extension at rupture minus the initial elastic extension.\n    N * \u03b4_p = \u03b4_rupture - \u03b4_y\n    N = (\u03b4_rupture - \u03b4_y) / \u03b4_p\n\n**Calculations:**\n1.  **Permanent extension per drop (\u03b4_p):**\n    From part (d), \u03b4_max = 9.108 mm.\n    From part (b), \u03b4_y = 5.952 mm.\n    \u03b4_p = 9.108 mm - 5.952 mm = 3.156 mm\n\n2.  **Total extension at rupture (\u03b4_rupture):**\n    \u03b4_rupture = \u03b5_r * L = 0.25 * 2500 mm = 625 mm\n\n3.  **Number of drops (N):**\n    N = (\u03b4_rupture - \u03b4_y) / \u03b4_p\n    N = (625 mm - 5.952 mm) / 3.156 mm\n    N = 619.048 / 3.156 \u2248 196.15\n\nThe wire can sustain 196 full drops. It will fail during the 197th drop.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe wire can sustain **196 drops** before rupturing.",
