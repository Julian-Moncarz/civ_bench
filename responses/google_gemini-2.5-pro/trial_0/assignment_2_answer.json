  "answer": "Of course. As a dedicated civil engineering student, I will provide a thorough and well-explained solution to this mechanics of materials problem.\n\n### **Assumptions and Material Properties**\n\nBefore starting, we need to establish the material properties for \"low alloy steel\". Standard values will be used:\n*   **Modulus of Elasticity (Young's Modulus), E:** 200 GPa = 200 x 10\u2079 N/m\u00b2\n*   **Yield Strength, \u03c3_y:** 350 MPa = 350 x 10\u2076 N/m\u00b2 (This is a typical value; \"no permanent deformations\" relates directly to this yield point).\n\nWe will also use the acceleration due to gravity, g = 9.81 m/s\u00b2.\n\n### **Given Information and Initial Calculations**\n\n*   Wire Length, L = 2,500 mm = 2.5 m\n*   Wire Diameter, d = 6 mm = 0.006 m\n*   Cross-sectional Area, A = \u03c0 * (d/2)\u00b2 = \u03c0 * (0.003 m)\u00b2 = 2.8274 x 10\u207b\u2075 m\u00b2\n*   Dropped Mass, m = 4 kg\n*   Weight of Mass, W = m * g = 4 kg * 9.81 m/s\u00b2 = 39.24 N\n*   Rupture Strain, \u03b5_rupture = 0.25\n\n---\n\n### **a. What is the impact velocity of the dropped mass just before it hits the catch plate?**\n\n**Reasoning:**\nWe can find the impact velocity (v) by applying the principle of conservation of energy. The potential energy (PE) of the mass at height *h* is converted into kinetic energy (KE) just before it strikes the plate.\n\n*   Potential Energy: PE = m * g * h\n*   Kinetic Energy: KE = \u00bd * m * v\u00b2\n\nEquating the two:\nm * g * h = \u00bd * m * v\u00b2\n\n**Calculation:**\nSolving for v:\nv\u00b2 = 2 * g * h\n**v = \u221a(2gh)**\n\nThis is the exact algebraic expression for the impact velocity.\n\n---\n\n### **b. What is the maximum value of *h* which does not cause any permanent deformations in the wire?**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\"No permanent deformation\" means the maximum stress in the wire (\u03c3_max) must not exceed the yield strength (\u03c3_y). This is the elastic limit. We use the work-energy principle for the entire impact event. The total potential energy lost by the mass is converted into elastic strain energy in the wire.\n\nThe mass falls a distance of (h + \u03b4_max), where \u03b4_max is the maximum extension of the wire. The work done by gravity is W * (h + \u03b4_max). The maximum strain energy stored in the wire is U = \u00bd * P_max * \u03b4_max.\n\n*   Work-Energy Equation: W * (h + \u03b4_max) = U = \u00bd * P_max * \u03b4_max\n*   At the elastic limit: \u03c3_max = \u03c3_y, P_max = P_y = \u03c3_y * A, and \u03b4_max = \u03b4_y = (\u03c3_y * L) / E.\n\n**Calculations:**\n1.  **Calculate Yield Force (P_y) and Yield Extension (\u03b4_y):**\n    *   P_y = \u03c3_y * A = (350 x 10\u2076 N/m\u00b2) * (2.8274 x 10\u207b\u2075 m\u00b2) = 9,895.9 N\n    *   \u03b4_y = (\u03c3_y * L) / E = (350 x 10\u2076 N/m\u00b2 * 2.5 m) / (200 x 10\u2079 N/m\u00b2) = 0.004375 m\n\n2.  **Apply the Work-Energy Equation:**\n    W * (h_max + \u03b4_y) = \u00bd * P_y * \u03b4_y\n    39.24 N * (h_max + 0.004375 m) = \u00bd * (9,895.9 N) * (0.004375 m)\n\n3.  **Solve for h_max:**\n    39.24 * h_max + (39.24 * 0.004375) = 21.648 J\n    39.24 * h_max + 0.1717 = 21.648 J\n    39.24 * h_max = 21.476 J\n    h_max = 21.476 / 39.24 = 0.547 m\n\n**Answer:**\nThe maximum value of *h* which does not cause permanent deformation is **0.547 m** (or 547 mm).\n\n---\n\n### **c. If h = 2.2 m, what is the maximum force experienced by the wire at any point during the drop?**\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe given drop height h = 2.2 m is greater than the maximum height for elastic behavior (h_max = 0.547 m) calculated in part (b). This means the wire will yield.\n\nThe problem states that strain-hardening effects are neglected. This implies an elastic-perfectly plastic material model. Once the material yields, the stress remains constant at the yield stress (\u03c3_y), and the force remains constant at the yield force (P_y), until rupture.\n\nTherefore, the maximum force the wire can experience is the yield force.\n\n**Calculation:**\nP_max = P_y = \u03c3_y * A\nP_max = (350 x 10\u2076 N/m\u00b2) * (2.8274 x 10\u207b\u2075 m\u00b2) = 9,895.9 N\n\n**Answer:**\nThe maximum force experienced by the wire is **9,896 N** (or 9.90 kN).\n\n---\n\n### **d. If h = 2.2 m, calculate the maximum extension of the wire caused by the weight landing on the catch-plate.**\n\n**Reasoning:**\nSince we know the wire yields, we must account for both elastic and plastic energy absorption. The total work done by gravity is converted into the energy required to bring the wire to the yield point (U_y) plus the plastic work done to stretch it further (W_p).\n\n*   Work Done by Gravity = W * (h + \u03b4_max)\n*   Energy to Yield (U_y) = \u00bd * P_y * \u03b4_y\n*   Plastic Work (W_p) = P_y * (\u03b4_max - \u03b4_y)\n*   Total Energy Absorbed = U_y + W_p = \u00bd * P_y * \u03b4_y + P_y * \u03b4_max - P_y * \u03b4_y = P_y * \u03b4_max - \u00bd * P_y * \u03b4_y\n\nEquating work done to energy absorbed:\nW * (h + \u03b4_max) = P_y * \u03b4_max - \u00bd * P_y * \u03b4_y\n\n**Calculation:**\n1.  **Rearrange the equation to solve for \u03b4_max:**\n    W*h + W*\u03b4_max = P_y*\u03b4_max - \u00bd*P_y*\u03b4_y\n    W*h + \u00bd*P_y*\u03b4_y = P_y*\u03b4_max - W*\u03b4_max\n    W*h + \u00bd*P_y*\u03b4_y = (P_y - W) * \u03b4_max\n    \u03b4_max = (W*h + \u00bd*P_y*\u03b4_y) / (P_y - W)\n\n2.  **Substitute known values:**\n    *   W*h = 39.24 N * 2.2 m = 86.328 J\n    *   \u00bd*P_y*\u03b4_y = 21.648 J (from part b)\n    *   P_y - W = 9,895.9 N - 39.24 N = 9,856.66 N\n\n    \u03b4_max = (86.328 J + 21.648 J) / 9,856.66 N\n    \u03b4_max = 107.976 J / 9,856.66 N\n    \u03b4_max = 0.010955 m\n\n**Answer:**\nThe maximum extension of the wire is **10.96 mm**.\n\n---\n\n### **e. If the mass is repeatedly dropped from a height of h = 2.2 m, how many drops can the wire sustain before rupturing?**\n\n**Reasoning:**\nEach drop from h = 2.2 m causes the wire to yield and undergo permanent (plastic) deformation. The wire will rupture when the cumulative plastic strain reaches the available plastic strain before fracture. We assume the plastic extension per drop is constant.\n\n1.  **Total available plastic extension (\u0394L_plastic_total):** The wire ruptures at \u03b5_rupture = 0.25. The elastic strain at yield is \u03b5_y. The plastic deformation begins after this point.\n    *   Total extension at rupture: \u03b4_rupture = \u03b5_rupture * L\n    *   Elastic extension component: \u03b4_y = (\u03c3_y * L) / E\n    *   Total plastic extension capacity: \u0394L_plastic_total = \u03b4_rupture - \u03b4_y\n\n2.  **Plastic extension per drop (\u03b4_plastic_per_drop):** This is the permanent set after one drop. It is the maximum extension (\u03b4_max) minus the elastic recovery (which is equal to \u03b4_y).\n    *   \u03b4_plastic_per_drop = \u03b4_max - \u03b4_y\n\n3.  **Number of drops (N):**\n    *   N = Total plastic extension capacity / Plastic extension per drop\n\n**Calculations:**\n1.  **Calculate total plastic extension capacity:**\n    *   \u03b4_rupture = 0.25 * 2.5 m = 0.625 m\n    *   \u03b4_y = 0.004375 m (from part b)\n    *   \u0394L_plastic_total = 0.625 m - 0.004375 m = 0.620625 m\n\n2.  **Calculate plastic extension per drop:**\n    *   \u03b4_max = 0.010955 m (from part d)\n    *   \u03b4_plastic_per_drop = 0.010955 m - 0.004375 m = 0.00658 m\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of drops:**\n    *   N = 0.620625 m / 0.00658 m \u2248 94.32 drops\n\n**Answer:**\nThe wire can sustain **94** complete drops. It will rupture during the 95th drop.",
