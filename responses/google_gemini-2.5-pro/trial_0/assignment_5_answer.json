The yield stress is $F_y = 350 \\text{ MPa}$ and the modulus of elasticity is $E = 200,000 \\text{ MPa}$.\n*   **Design Code:** Principles of CSA S16-14 \"Design of Steel Structures\" are used for member capacity calculations. A resistance factor of $\\phi = 0.9$ is used for tension and compression.\n*   **Factored Loads:** The member forces provided in the truss diagram are assumed to be the final factored loads, $P_f$ (where $C_f$ is compressive force and $T_f$ is tensile force).\n*   **Effective Length Factor:** For all truss members, the effective length factor is taken as $K=1.0$, assuming they are connected with theoretical pins.\n*   **Member Lengths:** From the elevation view, the truss height is $h=4.33$ m and the panel width is $5.0$ m.\n    *   Length of horizontal chord members: $L_{chord} = 5.0 \\text{ m} = 5000 \\text{ mm}$.\n    *   Length of diagonal members: $L_{diag} = \\sqrt{(4.33)^2 + (5.0/2)^2} = \\sqrt{18.7489 + 6.25} = \\sqrt{25.0} = 5.0 \\text{ m} = 5000 \\text{",
