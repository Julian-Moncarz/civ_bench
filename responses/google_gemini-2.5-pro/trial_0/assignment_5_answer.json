  "answer": "Here is a complete solution to the assignment questions, presented in the style of a top civil engineering student.\n\n### **General Assumptions**\n*   **Steel Grade:** CSA G40.21 Grade 350W steel is assumed, which is common for structures in Canada. The yield strength is $F_y = 350$ MPa. The modulus of elasticity is $E = 200,000$ MPa.\n*   **Design Code:** Principles from the Canadian steel design standard, CSA S16, are used. The resistance factor for steel members is $\\phi = 0.90$.\n*   **Member Connections:** All truss members are assumed to be connected with pins for analysis, so the effective length factor is K=1.0.\n*   **Factored Loads:** The forces provided in the diagram are assumed to be the factored loads ($C_f$ for compression, $T_f$ for tension).\n*   **HSS Sections:** Square Hollow Structural Sections (HSS) manufactured to CSA G40.20/G40.21 Class C will be used. For Class C HSS, the compressive resistance is calculated using the formula $C_r = \\phi A F_{cr}$ with $F_{cr} = F_y(1+\\lambda^{2n})^{-1/n}$, where $n=1.34$.\n*   **Slenderness Limit:** The specified slenderness limit of $L/r < 200$ will be satisfied for all members.\n\n***\n\n### **Question 1a: Top Chord Member Selection**\n\nThe top chord consists of members B, D, F, H, J, L. We must choose a single HSS section for all of them. The design will be governed by the member with the highest compressive force.\n\n1.  **Identify Critical Member:** From the provided force diagram, the member with the maximum compressive force is **FH**, with a force $C_f = 52.9$ kN.\n2.  **Determine Member Properties:**\n    *   Force: $C_f = 52.9$ kN (Compression)\n    *   Unbraced Length (L): The horizontal distance between joints is 5 m. So, L = 5000 mm.\n3.  **Apply Slenderness Limit:** The minimum required radius of gyration ($r_{min}$) is:\n    $r_{min} > L/200 = 5000 \\text{ mm} / 200 = 25$ mm.\n4.  **Select and Check a Trial Section:** We need a section that meets the slenderness limit and has a compressive resistance $C_r \\geq 52.9$ kN.\n\n    *   **Trial 1: HSS 76x76x3.2 (Class C)**\n        *   Properties: Area (A) = 907 mm\u00b2, Radius of gyration (r) = 29.5 mm.\n        *   Slenderness Check: r = 29.5 mm > 25 mm. **(OK)**\n        *   Capacity Check:\n            *   Slenderness ratio: $KL/r = (1.0 \\times 5000) / 29.5 = 169.5$\n            *   Slenderness parameter: $\\lambda = \\frac{KL}{r}\\sqrt{\\frac{F_y}{\\pi^2E}} = 169.5\\sqrt{\\frac{350}{\\pi^2(200000)}} = 2.25$\n            *   Critical stress: $F_{cr} = \\frac{F_y}{(1+\\lambda^{2n})^{1/n}} = \\frac{350}{(1+2.25^{2\\times1.34})^{1/1.34}} = 46.6$ MPa\n            *   Compressive Resistance: $C_r = \\phi A F_{cr} = 0.9 \\times 907 \\text{ mm}^2 \\times 46.6 \\text{ MPa} = 38,000 \\text{ N} = 38.0$ kN.\n        *   Result: $C_r = 38.0$ kN < $C_f = 52.9$ kN. **(FAIL)**\n\n    *   **Trial 2: HSS 76x76x4.8 (Class C)**\n        *   Properties: A = 1330 mm\u00b2, r = 29.0 mm.\n        *   Slenderness Check: r = 29.0 mm > 25 mm. **(OK)**\n        *   Capacity Check:\n            *   Slenderness ratio: $KL/r = (1.0 \\times 5000) / 29.0 = 172.4$\n            *   Slenderness parameter: $\\lambda = 172.4\\sqrt{\\frac{350}{\\pi^2(200000)}} = 2.29$\n            *   Critical stress: $F_{cr} = \\frac{350}{(1+2.29^{2.68})^{1/1.34}} = 44.3$ MPa\n            *   Compressive Resistance: $C_r = \\phi A F_{cr} = 0.9 \\times 1330 \\text{ mm}^2 \\times 44.3 \\text{ MPa} = 53,000 \\text{ N} = 53.0$ kN.\n        *   Result: $C_r = 53.0$ kN > $C_f = 52.9$ kN. **(OK)**\n\nThis section is lightweight and satisfies both the strength and slenderness requirements.\n\n**Answer 1a:** The chosen HSS designation for all top chord members is **HSS 76x76x4.8**.\n\n***\n\n### **Question 1b: Bottom Chord Member Selection**\n\nThe bottom chord consists of members AC, CE, EG, GI, IK, KM. The design is governed by the member with the highest tensile force, but slenderness must also be checked.\n\n1.  **Identify Critical Member:** From the diagram, the maximum tensile force is in member **EG**, with a force $T_f = 49.1$ kN.\n2.  **Determine Member Properties:**\n    *   Force: $T_f = 49.1$ kN (Tension)\n    *   Unbraced Length (L): L = 5000 mm.\n3.  **Apply Slenderness Limit:** As before, $r_{min} > 25$ mm.\n4.  **Select and Check a Trial Section:** The required tensile resistance is $T_r \\geq 49.1$ kN. The design will likely be governed by the slenderness limit.\n\n    *   We need the lightest section with $r_{min} > 25$ mm. From steel tables, the **HSS 76x76x3.2** is a candidate.\n        *   Properties: A = 907 mm\u00b2, r = 29.5 mm.\n        *   Slenderness Check: r = 29.5 mm > 25 mm. **(OK)**\n        *   Strength Check:\n            *   Tensile Resistance: $T_r = \\phi A_g F_y = 0.9 \\times 907 \\text{ mm}^2 \\times 350 \\text{ MPa} = 285,700 \\text{ N} = 285.7$ kN.\n        *   Result: $T_r = 285.7$ kN >> $T_f = 49.1$ kN. **(OK)**\n\nWhile the strength capacity is much higher than required, this is the lightest standard HSS section that meets the slenderness requirement.\n\n**Answer 1b:** The chosen HSS designation for all bottom chord members is **HSS 76x76x3.2**.\n\n***\n\n### **Question 1c: Diagonal Member Selection**\n\nThere are 12 diagonal members. The design must be safe for the member with the highest force magnitude, considering both tension and compression.\n\n1.  **Identify Critical Member:**\n    *   Maximum Tension: Member AB, $T_f = +37.6$ kN.\n    *   Maximum Compression: Member BC, $C_f = -37.6$ kN.\n    *   The critical force magnitude is 37.6 kN. Since compression is more critical for section selection than tension for the same force magnitude, we will design for $C_f = 37.6$ kN.\n2.  **Determine Member Properties:**\n    *   Force: $C_f = 37.6$ kN (Compression)\n    *   Unbraced Length (L): The diagonals form equilateral triangles with the top chord members.\n        $L = \\sqrt{(\\text{height})^2 + (\\text{base}/2)^2} = \\sqrt{(4.33 \\text{ m})^2 + (2.5 \\text{ m})^2} = \\sqrt{18.75 + 6.25} = \\sqrt{25} = 5.0$ m.\n        L = 5000 mm.\n3.  **Apply Slenderness Limit:** $r_{min} > L/200 = 5000 \\text{ mm} / 200 = 25$ mm.\n4.  **Select and Check a Trial Section:** We need a section with $r_{min} > 25$ mm and $C_r \\geq 37.6$ kN.\n\n    *   **Trial 1: HSS 76x76x3.2 (Class C)**\n        *   Properties: A = 907 mm\u00b2, r = 29.5 mm.\n        *   Slenderness Check: r = 29.5 mm > 25 mm. **(OK)**\n        *   Capacity Check: We already calculated the compressive resistance for this section with L=5000mm in Question 1a.\n            *   $C_r = 38.0$ kN.\n        *   Result: $C_r = 38.0$ kN > $C_f = 37.6$ kN. **(OK)**\n\nThis section provides just enough capacity and meets the slenderness limit, making it an efficient and lightweight choice.\n\n**Answer 1c:** The chosen HSS designation for all diagonal members is **HSS 76x76x3.2**.\n\n***\n\n### **Question 1d: Applied Wind Joint Loads**\n\n**Assumptions:**\n*   The wind pressure of 2.0 kPa ($2.0 \\text{ kN/m}^2$) acts on the vertical face of the bridge, which includes a 1.2 m tall railing.\n*   For simplicity, we will consider only the wind load on the railing and assume it is transferred equally (50/50 split) to the top and bottom chord lateral bracing systems.\n*   Tributary areas are based on the main truss panel points.\n\n**Calculations:**\n*   Total bridge length = 30 m.\n*   Total railing area = 30 m \u00d7 1.2 m = 36 m\u00b2.\n*   Total wind force on railing = 36 m\u00b2 \u00d7 2.0 kN/m\u00b2 = 72.0 kN.\n*   Total force on top bracing system = 72.0 kN / 2 = 36.0 kN.\n*   Total force on bottom bracing system = 72.0 kN / 2 = 36.0 kN.\n\n**Load Distribution to Joints:**\n\n*   **Top Brace Loads:** The top chord has 6 joints (B, D, F, H, J, L) that are not at the supports. The total force of 36.0 kN is distributed among them. Assuming the associated tributary length for each is one panel width (5 m):\n    *   Load per joint = (Panel Length \u00d7 Railing Height \u00d7 Pressure) / 2\n    *   Load = (5 m \u00d7 1.2 m \u00d7 2.0 kN/m\u00b2) / 2 = **6.0 kN**\n    *   This results in a total load of 6 joints \u00d7 6.0 kN/joint = 36.0 kN, which matches.\n\n*   **Bottom Brace Loads:** The bottom chord has 7 joints (A, C, E, G, I, K, M).\n    *   **Interior Joints (C, E, G, I, K):** Tributary length = 5 m.\n        *   Load = (5 m \u00d7 1.2 m \u00d7 2.0 kN/m\u00b2) / 2 = **6.0 kN**\n    *   **End Joints (A, M):** Tributary length = 2.5 m.\n        *   Load = (2.5 m \u00d7 1.2 m \u00d7 2.0 kN/m\u00b2) / 2 = **3.0 kN**\n    *   Total load check: (5 joints \u00d7 6.0 kN) + (2 joints \u00d7 3.0 kN) = 30.0 + 6.0 = 36.0 kN. This matches.\n\n**Answer 1d:**\n*   The applied joint load on the **top** bracing system is **6.0 kN** at each of the six joints (B, D, F, H, J, L).\n*   The applied joint loads on the **bottom** bracing system are **3.0 kN** at the end joints (A, M) and **6.0 kN** at each of the five interior joints (C, E, G, I, K).\n\n***\n\n### **Question 1e: Top and Bottom Brace Member Forces**\n\nWe will analyze the top and bottom bracing trusses as simply supported Pratt trusses. The trusses are 30 m long (6 panels @ 5 m) and 3 m wide.\n\n**Bottom Bracing Truss Analysis:**\n*   Supports at A and M.\n*   Loads: 3.0 kN at A and M; 6.0 kN at C, E, G, I, K.\n*   Total Load = 2(3.0) + 5(6.0) = 36.0 kN.\n*   Reactions: By symmetry, $R_A = R_M = 36.0 / 2 = 18.0$ kN.\n*   The shear force (V) in each panel determines the force in the diagonal. The vertical component of the diagonal force equals the panel shear.\n    *   Diagonal Length = $\\sqrt{5^2+3^2} = \\sqrt{34} \\approx 5.83$ m.\n    *   Angle $\\theta$ with horizontal: $\\sin\\theta = 3/\\sqrt{34}$.\n    *   Diagonal Force $|F_d| = V / \\sin\\theta = V \\times (\\sqrt{34}/3)$.\n*   **Panel Shear Calculations (working from left support A):**\n    *   $V_{AC} = R_A - P_A = 18.0 - 3.0 = 15.0$ kN.\n    *   $V_{CE} = V_{AC} - P_C = 15.0 - 6.0 = 9.0$ kN.\n    *   $V_{EG} = V_{CE} - P_E = 9.0 - 6.0 = 3.0$ kN.\n    *   By symmetry, shears are 15.0, 9.0, 3.0, -3.0, -9.0, -15.0 kN.\n*   **Diagonal Forces (All are in tension for a Pratt truss with this loading):**\n    *   $F_{d1} = 15.0 \\times (\\sqrt{34}/3) = 5\\sqrt{34} = +29.15$ kN.\n    *   $F_{d2} = 9.0 \\times (\\sqrt{34}/3) = 3\\sqrt{34} = +17.50$ kN.\n    *   $F_{d3} = 3.0 \\times (\\sqrt{34}/3) = \\sqrt{34} = +5.83$ kN.\n    *   The forces are symmetric for the other half of the truss.\n\n**Top Bracing Truss Analysis:**\nBased on a reasonable interpretation that the wind load from the main truss panels is lumped at the bracing nodes, the loading pattern on the top bracing truss becomes identical to the bottom one.\n*   Effective loads: 6.0 kN at the 5 interior nodes, 3.0 kN at the 2 end nodes.\n*   Reactions and shear forces will be identical to the bottom bracing system.\n*   Therefore, the forces in the top bracing members are the same as in the bottom bracing members.\n\n**Answer 1e:** The forces in the brace members are shown below (Tension is +, Compression is -).\n\n**Top View (Top Braces):**\n\n*(Note: Diagonals are in tension, struts between trusses would be in compression).*\n\n**Bottom View (Bottom Braces):**\n\n*(Note: Diagonals are in tension, struts between trusses would be in compression).*\n\n***\n\n### **Question 1f: Top and Bottom Brace Member Selection**\n\nWe need to choose one HSS section for all braces (top and bottom). The design must account for wind reversal, meaning a member in tension could also experience compression of the same magnitude. The design is governed by compression.\n\n1.  **Identify Critical Force:** The maximum force magnitude from part (e) is **29.15 kN**. We must design for $C_f = 29.15$ kN.\n2.  **Determine Member Properties:**\n    *   Force: $C_f = 29.15$ kN (Compression)\n    *   Unbraced Length (L): Length of the diagonal = $\\sqrt{5^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{34} = 5.831$ m = 5831 mm.\n3.  **Apply Slenderness Limit:**\n    $r_{min} > L/200 = 5831 \\text{ mm} / 200 = 29.16$ mm.\n4.  **Select and Check a Trial Section:**\n\n    *   **Trial 1: HSS 76x76x4.8 (Class C)**\n        *   Properties: A = 1330 mm\u00b2, r = 29.0 mm.\n        *   Slenderness Check: r = 29.0 mm < 29.16 mm. **(FAIL)**. This section is not acceptable regardless of strength.\n\n    *   **Trial 2: HSS 89x89x3.2 (Class C)**\n        *   Properties: A = 1080 mm\u00b2, r = 34.9 mm.\n        *   Slenderness Check: r = 34.9 mm > 29.16 mm. **(OK)**\n        *   Capacity Check:\n            *   Slenderness ratio: $KL/r = (1.0 \\times 5831) / 34.9 = 167.1$\n            *   Slenderness parameter: $\\lambda = 167.1\\sqrt{\\frac{350}{\\pi^2(200000)}} = 2.22$\n            *   Critical stress: $F_{cr} = \\frac{350}{(1+2.22^{2\\times1.34})^{1/1.34}} = 48.6$ MPa\n            *   Compressive Resistance: $C_r = \\phi A F_{cr} = 0.9 \\times 1080 \\text{ mm}^2 \\times 48.6 \\text{ MPa} = 47,175 \\text{ N} = 47.2$ kN.\n        *   Result: $C_r = 47.2$ kN > $C_f = 29.15$ kN. **(OK)**\n\nThis section is the lightest standard HSS profile that meets both the slenderness and strength requirements for the bracing members.\n\n**Answer 1f:** The chosen HSS designation for both the top and bottom braces is **HSS 89x89x3.2**.",
