Here is a detailed solution to the assignment questions.\n\n### **Preamble: Initial Analysis**\n\nBefore answering the specific questions, we need to understand the truss geometry, member properties, and perform a static analysis to find the internal forces under the given loads.\n\n**1. Truss Geometry and Member Lengths:**\nThe truss shown is a Warren truss.\n*   The total span is 4 panels \u00d7 6 m/panel = 24 m.\n*   The height of the truss is 4 m.\n*   The top chord nodes (B, D, F, H) are located horizontally midway between the bottom chord nodes.\n*   Length of horizontal members (top and bottom chords): L_h = 6 m.\n*   Length of diagonal members: L_d = \u221a((6/2)\u00b2 + 4\u00b2) = \u221a(3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2) = 5 m.\n\n**2. Member Properties (Areas):**\nWe will calculate the cross-sectional areas (A) from the given HSS dimensions (b\u00d7h\u00d7t). A = (b\u00d7h) - (b-2t)\u00d7(h-2t).\n*   **Top Chord (HSS 178\u00d7178\u00d74.8):** A_top = 178\u00b2 - (178 - 2\u00d74.8)\u00b2 = 3330 mm\u00b2.\n*   **Bottom Chord (HSS 127\u00d751\u00d74.8):** A_bot = (127\u00d751) - (127 - 2\u00d74.8)\u00d7(51 - 2\u00d74.8) = 1636 mm\u00b2.\n*   **Diagonal Members (HSS 127\u00d7127\u00d74.8):** A_diag = 127\u00b2 - (127 - 2\u00d74.8)\u00b2 = 2350 mm\u00b2.\n*   **Elastic Modulus (E):** E = 200 GPa = 200,000 N/mm\u00b2.\n\n**3. Static Force Analysis (Real Forces 'N'):**\nThe truss and loading are symmetric.\n*   Total load = 3 \u00d7 80 kN = 240 kN.\n*   Support reactions: R_A = R_I = 240 kN / 2 = 120 kN.\n\nWe can find the internal forces using the method of joints or sections. The angle \u03b8 of the diagonals with the horizontal is tan\u207b\u00b9(4/3), so sin(\u03b8) = 4/5 and cos(\u03b8) = 3/5.\n\nBy analyzing the shear in each panel, we can quickly find diagonal forces (N_diag = V / sin(\u03b8)). By using method of sections, we find chord forces. The forces (N) in each member are (T for Tension, C for Compression):\n\n*   **Left Half & Center:**\n    *   N_AB = -150 kN (C)\n    *   N_AC = +90 kN (T)\n    *   N_BC = +150 kN (T)\n    *   N_BD = -180 kN (C)\n    *   N_CD = -50 kN (C)\n    *   N_CE = +210 kN (T)\n    *   N_DE = +50 kN (T)\n    *   N_DF = -240 kN (C)\n*   **Right Half (by symmetry):**\n    *   N_HI = N_AB = -150 kN (C)\n    *   N_GI = N_AC = +90 kN (T)\n    *   N_GH = N_BC = +150 kN (T)\n    *   N_FH = N_BD = -180 kN (C)\n    *   N_FG = N_CD = -50 kN (C)\n    *   N_EG = N_CE = +210 kN (T)\n    *   N_EF = N_DE = +50 kN (T)\n\n---\n\n### **Question 2a: Calculate the vertical displacement of joint E due to the current loading.**\n\nWe will use the **Method of Virtual Work** to find the displacement.\n\u03b4 = \u03a3 (N * n * L) / (A * E)\nwhere 'N' are the real forces calculated above, and 'n' are the virtual forces from a single 1 kN vertical load at joint E.\n\n**Virtual Force Analysis (Virtual Forces 'n'):**\nApply a 1 kN load vertically at E. The structure is symmetric.\n*   Virtual reactions: R'_A = R'_I = 1 kN / 2 = 0.5 kN.\n*   The virtual forces 'n' are found using the same analysis methods:\n    *   n_AB = -0.625 kN (C)\n    *   n_AC = +0.375 kN (T)\n    *   n_BC = +0.625 kN (T)\n    *   n_BD = -0.75 kN (C)\n    *   n_CD = -0.625 kN (T) (Note: sign differs from N because shear is in same direction but diagonal has opposite slope)\n    *   n_CE = +1.125 kN (T)\n    *   n_DE = +0.625 kN (T)\n    *   n_DF = -1.5 kN (C)\n    *   The right half is symmetric.\n\n**Calculation Table:**\nWe can calculate the sum for one half and the central member (DF) and use symmetry.\n\u03a3(NnL/A) = 2 \u00d7 \u03a3(NnL/A)_left_half + (NnL/A)_DF_center\nThe calculation covers members AB, BC, AC, CD, DE, BD, CE for the left side, and DF for the center.\n\n| Member | N (kN) | n (kN) | L (mm) | A (mm\u00b2) | Type | NnL/A (kN\u00b2\u00b7mm/mm\u00b2) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- | :---: |\n| AB, HI | -150 | -0.625 | 5000 | 2350 | Diag | 2 \u00d7 199.47 = 398.94 |\n| BC, GH | +150 | +0.625 | 5000 | 2350 | Diag | 2 \u00d7 199.47 = 398.94 |\n| AC, GI | +90 | +0.375 | 6000 | 1636 | Bot | 2 \u00d7 123.78 = 247.56 |\n| CD, FG | -50 | -0.625 | 5000 | 2350 | Diag | 2 \u00d7 66.49 = 132.98 |\n| DE, EF | +50 | +0.625 | 5000 | 2350 | Diag | 2 \u00d7 66.49 = 132.98 |\n| BD, FH | -180 | -0.75 | 6000 | 3330 | Top | 2 \u00d7 243.24 = 486.48 |\n| CE, EG | +210 | +1.125 | 6000 | 1636 | Bot | 2 \u00d7 866.59 = 1733.18 |\n| DF | -240 | -1.5 | 6000 | 3330 | Top | 1 \u00d7 648.65 = 648.65 |\n| **Total** | | | | | | **\u03a3 = 4179.71** |\n\nNow, we calculate the displacement:\n\u03b4_E = (1/E) * \u03a3(NnL/A)\nNote that N is in kN, n is in kN, so the numerator product is in kN\u00b2. To get the final answer in mm, we must be consistent with units. E = 200 kN/mm\u00b2.\n\u03b4_E = (1 / 200 kN/mm\u00b2) * (4179.71 kN\u00b2\u00b7mm/mm\u00b2)\n\u03b4_E = 20.898 mm\n\n**Answer 2a:** The vertical displacement of joint E is **20.9 mm**.\n\n---\n\n### **Question 2b: Using your result in part (a.), estimate the natural frequency (Hz) of this truss bridge.**\n\nWe can estimate the natural frequency by modeling the bridge as an equivalent Single-Degree-of-Freedom (SDOF) system. The mass of the system is assumed to be the mass of the objects causing the loads, and the stiffness is the equivalent stiffness of the truss at the point of maximum displacement.\n\n*   **Equivalent Stiffness (k_eff):** Stiffness is force divided by displacement. We use the total static load and the maximum static displacement (at joint E).\n    k_eff = P_total / \u03b4_max = (3 \u00d7 80 kN) / 20.9 mm = 240 kN / 20.9 mm = 11.48 kN/mm\n    Converting to SI units: k_eff = 11.48 \u00d7 10\u2076 N/m.\n\n*   **Equivalent Mass (m_eff):** The mass is derived from the static loads.\n    m_eff = F / g = (3 \u00d7 80,000 N) / 9.81 m/s\u00b2 = 24,465 kg.\n\n*   **Natural Frequency (f_n):**\n    f_n = (1 / 2\u03c0) * \u221a(k_eff / m_eff)\n    f_n = (1 / 2\u03c0) * \u221a(11.48 \u00d7 10\u2076 N/m / 24,465 kg)\n    f_n = (1 / 2\u03c0) * \u221a(469.3) s\u207b\u00b9\n    f_n = 21.66 / (2\u03c0) = 3.448 Hz\n\n**Answer 2b:** The estimated natural frequency of the truss bridge is **3.45 Hz**.\n\n---\n\n### **Question 2c: Calculate the dynamic amplification factor, DAF.**\n\nThe Dynamic Amplification Factor (DAF) for a damped system under harmonic loading is given by:\nDAF = 1 / \u221a([1 - \u03b2\u00b2]\u00b2 + [2\u03b6\u03b2]\u00b2)\nwhere:\n*   Driving frequency, f = 2.75 Hz (given)\n*   Natural frequency, f_n = 3.45 Hz (from part b)\n*   Damping ratio, \u03b6 = 3% = 0.03 (given)\n*   Frequency ratio, \u03b2 = f / f_n\n\nFirst, calculate the frequency ratio:\n\u03b2 = 2.75 Hz / 3.45 Hz = 0.797\n\nNow, calculate the DAF:\nDAF = 1 / \u221a([1 - 0.797\u00b2]\u00b2 + [2 \u00d7 0.03 \u00d7 0.797]\u00b2)\nDAF = 1 / \u221a([1 - 0.635]\u00b2 + [0.0478]\u00b2)\nDAF = 1 / \u221a([0.365]\u00b2 + [0.0478]\u00b2)\nDAF = 1 / \u221a(0.1332 + 0.0023)\nDAF = 1 / \u221a0.1355 = 1 / 0.3681\n\nDAF = 2.716\n\n**Answer 2c:** The dynamic amplification factor (DAF) is **2.72**.\n\n---\n\n### **Question 2d: Determine the maximum load value and check for member yielding or buckling.**\n\nThe total load is composed of a static component (80 kN) and an oscillating dynamic component with amplitude P\u2080 = 20 kN.\n\n*   **Maximum Amplified Point Load (P_max):**\n    The maximum dynamic force is the amplitude amplified by the DAF. The total maximum force is the static force plus this amplified dynamic force.\n    P_max = P_static + DAF \u00d7 P\u2080\n    P_max = 80 kN + 2.72 \u00d7 20 kN\n    P_max = 80 kN + 54.4 kN = 134.4 kN\n\nThe maximum value of each point load is **134.4 kN**.\n\n*   **Member Check (Yield and Buckling):**\n    As per the hint, we can use the principle of linearity. The internal forces will be amplified by the same ratio as the external loads.\n    Force Amplification Factor = P_max / P_static = 134.4 kN / 80 kN = 1.68\n\n    **Yield Check:**\n    We check the member with the highest static stress, \u03c3 = N/A. From our initial analysis, member **CE** has the highest static stress:\n    \u03c3_static_CE = |N_CE / A_bot| = |210,000 N / 1636 mm\u00b2| = 128.4 MPa.\n    Maximum dynamic stress in CE:\n    \u03c3_max_CE = \u03c3_static_CE \u00d7 (Force Amplification Factor) = 128.4 MPa \u00d7 1.68 = 215.7 MPa.\n    Since \u03c3_max_CE (216 MPa) < \u03c3_yield (350 MPa), **the member will not yield.** No other members will yield, as their static stresses are lower.\n\n    **Buckling Check:**\n    We check the compression member with the highest potential for buckling. This is typically a combination of high compressive force and long length. The top chord member **DF** has the highest compressive force (N = -240 kN).\n    *   Maximum compressive force in DF: N_max_DF = |N_DF| \u00d7 1.68 = 240 kN \u00d7 1.68 = 403.2 kN.\n    *   Maximum compressive stress in DF: \u03c3_max_DF = N_max_DF / A_top = 403,200 N / 3330 mm\u00b2 = 121.1 MPa.\n    *   Now we compare this to the critical buckling stress (\u03c3_cr) using Euler's formula for a pinned-end column (L_e = L).\n        *   For member DF (HSS 178x178x4.8): L = 6000 mm. Radius of gyration r = 85.8 mm (calculated from section properties).\n        *   Slenderness ratio \u03bb = L/r = 6000 / 85.8 = 69.9.\n        *   \u03c3_cr = (\u03c0\u00b2E) / \u03bb\u00b2 = (\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 200,000 MPa) / (69.9)\u00b2 = 404 MPa.\n    *   Comparison: \u03c3_max_DF (121 MPa) < \u03c3_cr (404 MPa). **Member DF will not buckle.**\n\n    We can also check the longest compression member, AB (L=5000 mm).\n    *   N_max_AB = |-150 kN| \u00d7 1.68 = 252 kN.\n    *   \u03c3_max_AB = 252,000 N / 2350 mm\u00b2 = 107.2 MPa.\n    *   For member AB (HSS 127x127x4.8): L = 5000 mm. Radius of gyration r = 59.6 mm.\n    *   \u03bb = 5000 / 59.6 = 83.9.\n    *   \u03c3_cr = (\u03c0\u00b2 \u00d7 200,000 MPa) / (83.9)\u00b2 = 280 MPa.\n    *   Comparison: \u03c3_max_AB (107 MPa) < \u03c3_cr (280 MPa). **Member AB will not buckle.**\n\n**Answer 2d:** The maximum value of each point load is **134.4 kN**. Under these amplified loads, **no truss members are likely to yield or buckle.**\n\n---\n\n### **Question 2e: Calculate the maximum vertical displacement of the bridge at joint E due to dynamic effects.**\n\nAs per the hint, we can use the characteristics of a linear system. Since displacement is linearly proportional to the applied load (F=kx), the maximum dynamic displacement will be the static displacement amplified by the same factor as the total load.\n\n*   Static displacement at E, \u03b4_static_E = 20.9 mm (from part a).\n*   Force Amplification Factor = 1.68 (from part d).\n\nMaximum dynamic displacement at E:\n\u03b4_max_E = \u03b4_static_E \u00d7 (Force Amplification Factor)\n\u03b4_max_E = 20.9 mm \u00d7 1.68\n\u03b4_max_E = 35.11 mm\n\n**Answer 2e:** The maximum vertical displacement of the bridge at joint E due to dynamic effects is **35.1 mm**.",
