As a dedicated civil engineering student, I will provide a detailed, step-by-step solution to the problem.\n\n### **Initial Analysis & Member Properties**\n\nFirst, I will interpret the truss geometry and determine the properties of the specified HSS members.\n\n**1. Truss Geometry:**\nThe truss is a simply supported Warren truss.\n*   **Supports:** Pin at A, Roller at I.\n*   **Span:** 4 panels of 6m horizontal length = 24m total span.\n*   **Height:** 4m.\n*   **Joint Coordinates:** Assuming A is at (0,0):\n    *   Bottom Chord: A(0,0), C(6,0), E(12,0), G(18,0), I(24,0).\n    *   Top Chord: B(3,4), D(9,4), F(15,4), H(21,4).\n*   **Member Lengths:**\n    *   Bottom chord members (AC, CE, etc.): The problem states a 6m distance between joints (e.g., C to E). However, the drawing shows these are comprised of two 3m panels. We'll assume the 6m labels indicate the horizontal distance *between loads*, making each horizontal panel 6m long. So, member AC's length is 6m. Wait, the diagram shows C, E, G as joints where loads are applied, and A, B, D, F, H, I as other joints. The horizontal distance from A to C is 6m. This implies B is at x=3. This is the Warren Truss configuration.\n        *   Length of horizontal segments (AC, CE, EG, GI): L_horiz = 6 m.\n        *   Length of diagonal members (like",
