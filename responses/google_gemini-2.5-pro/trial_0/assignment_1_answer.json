We will use this principle to derive the required units.\n\n**Question 1a:**\n*   **Equation:** \u03c3 = P / A\n*   **Derive units for:** P, a force\n*   **Given Units:** \u03c3 is in GPa (gigapascals), A is in mm\u00b2\n\n**Derivation:**\n1.  Rearrange the equation to solve for P:\n    P = \u03c3 \u22c5 A\n2.  Substitute the given units into the rearranged equation:\n    Units of P = [GPa] \u22c5 [mm\u00b2]\n3.  Convert the units to a base system of Newtons (N) and meters (m) to understand the resulting unit.\n    *   1 GPa = 1 \u00d7 10\u2079 Pa\n    *   1 Pa = 1 N/m\u00b2\n    *   1 m = 1000 mm, so 1 m\u00b2 = (1000 mm)\u00b2 = 1 \u00d7 10\u2076 mm\u00b2. This means 1 mm\u00b2 = 1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m\u00b2.\n4.  Combine the conversions:\n    Units of P = (1 \u00d7 10\u2079 N/m\u00b2) \u22c5 (1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 m\u00b2)\n    Units of P = 1 \u00d7 10\u00b3 N = 1 kN\n\n**Answer:** The units of P are **kilonewtons (kN)**.\n\n---\n\n**Question 1b:**\n*   **Equation:** P = (\u03c0\u00b2EI) / L\u00b2\n*   **Derive units for:** E, a material stiffness\n*   **Given Units:** P is in N, E is in MPa, I is in mm\u2074. L is a length. For consistency, let's assume all lengths are in mm, as implied by the units for E and I.\n\n**Derivation:**\n1.  Rearrange the equation to solve for E. The term \u03c0\u00b2 is a dimensionless constant and can be ignored for unit analysis.\n    E = (P \u22c5 L\u00b2) / (I)\n2.  Substitute the known units. To maintain consistency, we must use `mm` for the length L.\n    Units of E = ([N] \u22c5 [mm\u00b2]) / [mm\u2074]\n3.  Simplify the expression:\n    Units of E = N / mm\u00b2\n4.  We know that 1 Pascal (Pa) = 1 N/m\u00b2, and 1 Megapascal (MPa) = 1 \u00d7 10\u2076 Pa.\n    Let's check if N/mm\u00b2 is equivalent to MPa:\n    1 N/mm\u00b2 = 1 N / (10\u207b\u00b3 m)\u00b2 = 1 N / (10\u207b\u2076 m\u00b2) = 1 \u00d7 10\u2076 N/m\u00b2 = 1 \u00d7 10\u2076 Pa = 1 MPa.\n\n**Answer:** The derived units for E are **N/mm\u00b2**, which is equivalent to **Megapascals (MPa)**.\n\n---\n\n**Question 1c:**\n*   **Equation:** \u03c6 = M / (EI)\n*   **Derive units for:** M, a moment\n*   **Given Units:** E has dimensions of [force per unit area] (e.g., N/mm\u00b2), I is in mm\u2074, \u03c6 is in rad/mm.\n\n**Derivation:**\n1.  Rearrange the equation to solve for M:\n    M = \u03c6 \u22c5 E \u22c5 I\n2.  Substitute the given units into the equation. The unit `radian` (rad) is dimensionless.\n    Units of M = [rad/mm] \u22c5 [Force/Area] \u22c5 [mm\u2074]\n3.  Let's use a consistent set of units: Force in Newtons (N) and length in millimeters (mm).\n    Area = [mm\u00b2].\n    Units of M = (1/mm) \u22c5 (N/mm\u00b2) \u22c5 (mm\u2074)\n4.  Simplify the expression:\n    Units of M = (N \u22c5 mm\u2074) / (mm\u00b3) = N \u22c5 mm\n\n**Answer:** The units of M are **Newton-millimeters (N\u00b7mm)**. This is a unit of moment (Force \u00d7 distance), which is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Question 1d:**\n*   **Equation:** \u03c4 = VQ / (Ib)\n*   **Derive units for:** Q, the first moment of area\n*   **Given Units:** \u03c4 is in MPa, V is in N, I is in mm\u2074, b is a length.\n\n**Derivation:**\n1.  Rearrange the equation to solve for Q:\n    Q = (\u03c4 \u22c5 I \u22c5 b) / V\n2.  Substitute the given units. We will use the consistent N and mm system.\n    *   \u03c4 (stress) in MPa is N/mm\u00b2.\n    *   I (second moment of area) is in mm\u2074.\n    *   b (length) is in mm.\n    *   V (shear force) is in N.\n    Units of Q = ([N/mm\u00b2] \u22c5 [mm\u2074] \u22c5 [mm]) / [N]\n3.  Simplify the expression:\n    Units of Q = (N \u22c5 mm\u2075 / mm\u00b2) / N = (N \u22c5 mm\u00b3) / N\n    Units of Q = mm\u00b3\n\n**Answer:** The units of Q are **cubic millimeters (mm\u00b3)**. This is correct, as the first moment of area has dimensions of length\u00b3.\n\n---\n\n**Question 1e:**\n*   **Equation:** Vc = \u03c6s \u22c5 (A'v \u22c5 fs \u22c5 dv / s) \u22c5 cot \u03b8\n*   **Derive units for:** A'v\n*   **Given Units:** Vc is in N, \u03c6s and cot \u03b8 are dimensionless, fs is a stress ([force per unit area]), dv and s are lengths (in mm).\n\n**Derivation:**\n1.  Rearrange the equation to solve for A'v. The dimensionless terms \u03c6s and cot \u03b8 can be ignored for unit analysis.\n    A'v = (Vc \u22c5 s) / (fs \u22c5 dv)\n2.  Substitute the units, using N for force and mm for length. The stress fs will be in N/mm\u00b2.\n    Units of A'v = ([N] \u22c5 [mm]) / ([N/mm\u00b2] \u22c5 [mm])\n3.  Simplify the expression in the denominator first:\n    [N/mm\u00b2] \u22c5 [mm] = N/mm\n4.  Now complete the simplification:\n    Units of A'v = (N \u22c5 mm) / (N / mm) = (N \u22c5 mm) \u22c5 (mm / N)\n    Units of A'v = mm\u00b2\n\n**Answer:** The units of A'v are **square millimeters (mm\u00b2)**. This makes sense as A'v represents an area (area of shear reinforcement).\n\n---\n### **Question 2: Pulley System**\n\n**Free Body Diagram (FBD) and Analysis:**\nTo solve for the forces, we will analyze the lower block of pulleys to which the weight 3W is attached.\n\n1.  **FBD of the Lower Pulley Block and Weight:**\n    *   **Downward Force:** The weight acting downwards is **3W**.\n    *   **Upward Forces:** The single continuous rope is wrapped around the two pulleys in the lower block. If we cut the rope just above this block, we see there are **four** segments of the rope pulling upwards on the block.\n    *   Let **T** be the tension in the continuous rope. Since it is one rope passing through a system of ideal (frictionless) pulleys, the tension is constant throughout its length.\n    *   The total upward force on the lower block is the sum of the tensions in these four segments: **T + T + T + T = 4T**.\n\n    *(A free body diagram would show a block with an arrow labeled \"3W\" pointing down, and four arrows labeled \"T\" pointing up.)*\n\n2.  **Equation of Equilibrium:**\n    For the system to be in static equilibrium, the sum of the vertical forces must be zero. Let's define the upward direction as positive.\n    \u03a3Fy = 0\n    4T - 3W = 0\n\n3.  **Solve for the Force (Tension):**\n    Rearrange the equation to solve for T:\n    4T = 3W\n    **T = (3/4)W** or **T = 0.75W**\n\n**Answer:**\nThe question asks for the forces in \"each of the wires\". In this system, there is one continuous rope (\"wire\") that is routed through the pulleys. The tension in this continuous rope is uniform.\n\n*   The force (tension) in the continuous rope is **T = 0.75W**.\n\nThe force in the \"wire\" or link connecting the lower pulley block to the mass is simply the weight of the mass, **3W**.\n\n---\n### **Question 3: Cable System**\n\n**Free Body Diagram (FBD) and Analysis:**\nThe system is in equilibrium. We will analyze the forces acting at joint B. First, we must determine the geometry of the system to find the angles of the cables.\n\n1.  **Determine Geometry:**\n    *   Let the origin be at point A. A = (0, 0).\n    *   Point C is at a horizontal distance of 1500 mm. Since the dashed line AC is horizontal, C = (1500, 0).\n    *   The length of cable AB is given as 1500 mm.\n    *   The total length of cable BCM is 2200 mm. This cable passes over an ideal pulley at C. The segment CM is vertical, and its length `S` is given as 0.8 m = 800 mm.\n    *   Therefore, the length of cable segment BC is: Length(BC) = Length(BCM) - Length(CM) = 2200 mm - 800 mm = 1400 mm.\n    *   We now have a triangle ABC with side lengths:\n        *   Side c (AB) = 1500 mm\n        *   Side b (AC) = 1500 mm\n        *   Side a (BC) = 1400 mm\n    *   Since AB = AC, this is an isosceles triangle. We can find the angles using the Law of Cosines. Let \u03b8_A be the angle at A (\u2220CAB) and \u03b8_C be the angle at C (\u2220ACB).\n    *   Find \u03b8_A:\n        a\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc\u22c5cos(\u03b8_A)\n        1400\u00b2 = 1500\u00b2 + 1500\u00b2 - 2(1500)(1500)\u22c5cos(\u03b8_A)\n        1,960,000 = 4,500,000 - 4,500,000\u22c5cos(\u03b8_A)\n        cos(\u03b8_A) = (4,500,000 - 1,960,000) / 4,500,000 = 2,540,000 / 4,500,000 \u2248 0.5644\n        **\u03b8_A \u2248 55.63\u00b0**\n    *   Find \u03b8_C:\n        c\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab\u22c5cos(\u03b8_C)\n        1500\u00b2 = 1400\u00b2 + 1500\u00b2 - 2(1400)(1500)\u22c5cos(\u03b8_C)\n        0 = 1400\u00b2 - 4,200,000\u22c5cos(\u03b8_C)\n        cos(\u03b8_C) = 1400\u00b2 / 4,200,000 = 1,960,000 / 4,200,000 = 14/30 = 7/15 \u2248 0.4667\n        **\u03b8_C \u2248 62.18\u00b0**\n\n2.  **Forces Calculation:**\n    *   Convert given masses to weights (forces) using g = 9.81 m/s\u00b2:\n        *   Weight at B (from P and D) = W_B = (m_P + m_D)g = (3 kg + 16 kg) \u00d7 9.81 m/s\u00b2 = 19 kg \u00d7 9.81 m/s\u00b2 = **186.39 N**.\n        *   Weight of M = W_M = M \u00d7 9.81 m/s\u00b2. This is what we need to find.\n    *   Since the cable BCM passes over a frictionless pulley at C, the tension is constant along it. Therefore, the tension in segment BC is equal to the weight of mass M.\n        *   **T_BC = W_M**\n    *   The tension in cable AB is T_AB.\n\n3.  **Equilibrium at Joint B:**\n    *(The FBD for joint B shows three forces: W_B acting vertically downwards, T_AB acting up and to the left at an angle \u03b8_A to the horizontal, and T_BC acting up and to the right at an angle \u03b8_C to the horizontal.)*\n    *   Sum of horizontal forces (\u03a3Fx = 0):\n        -T_AB\u22c5cos(\u03b8_A) + T_BC\u22c5cos(\u03b8_C) = 0\n        -T_AB\u22c5cos(55.63\u00b0) + T_BC\u22c5cos(62.18\u00b0) = 0\n        T_BC \u22c5 0.4667 = T_AB \u22c5 0.5644\n        T_BC = T_AB \u22c5 (0.5644 / 0.4667) \u2248 1.2093 \u22c5 T_AB\n    *   Sum of vertical forces (\u03a3Fy = 0):\n        T_AB\u22c5sin(\u03b8_A) + T_BC\u22c5sin(\u03b8_C) - W_B = 0\n        T_AB\u22c5sin(55.63\u00b0) + T_BC\u22c5sin(62.18\u00b0) - 186.39 = 0\n\n4.  **Solve for Tensions and Mass M:**\n    *   Substitute the expression for T_BC into the \u03a3Fy equation:\n        T_AB\u22c5sin(55.63\u00b0) + (1.2093 \u22c5 T_AB)\u22c5sin(62.18\u00b0) - 186.39 = 0\n        T_AB \u22c5 (0.8254) + (1.2093 \u22c5 T_AB) \u22c5 (0.8844) - 186.39 = 0\n        T_AB \u22c5 (0.8254 + 1.0694) = 186.39\n        T_AB \u22c5 1.8948 = 186.39\n        **T_AB \u2248 98.37 N**\n    *   Now find T_BC:\n        T_BC = 1.2093 \u22c5 T_AB = 1.2093 \u22c5 98.37 N \u2248 **118.96 N**\n    *   As established earlier, T_BC = W_M.\n        W_M = 118.96 N\n    *   Finally, find the mass M:\n        M = W_M / g = 118.96 N / 9.81 m/s\u00b2 \u2248 12.126 kg\n\n**Answer:**\nThe mass M required to maintain equilibrium is **12.1 kg**.\n\n---\n### **Question 4: Three-Wire System**\n\n**Free Body Diagram (FBD) and Analysis:**\nThe system is symmetric, but since the wires have different orientations, their elongations and tensions will be different. This is a statically indeterminate problem. We need both equilibrium and compatibility (deformation) equations.\n\n1.  **FBD and Equilibrium:**\n    *   Let's analyze the junction where the three wires meet and the load P is applied.\n    *   **Forces:**\n        *   Downward force: Load **P**\n        *   Upward tension in the middle wire: **T_mid**\n        *   Upward tension in the left and right slanted wires. By symmetry, these are equal: **T_slant**.\n    *   The angle \u03b8 is given between the slanted wires and the **vertical**.\n    *   *(The FBD shows a point with P acting down, T_mid acting straight up, and two T_slant forces acting up and out at an angle \u03b8 to the vertical.)*\n    *   **Equilibrium Equation (vertical forces):**\n        \u03a3Fy = 0\n        T_mid + T_slant\u22c5cos(\u03b8) + T_slant\u22c5cos(\u03b8) - P = 0\n        **P = T_mid + 2\u22c5T_slant\u22c5cos(\u03b8)**\n\n2.  **Compatibility (Deformation) Analysis:**\n    *   Let's assume the wires are made of the same material (same Young's Modulus, E) and have the same cross-sectional area (A). Let the junction point displace vertically downwards by a small amount \u03b4.\n    *   The elongation of the middle wire is simply \u03b4: **\u0394L_mid = \u03b4**.\n    *   The elongation of a slanted wire is found through geometry. For a small vertical displacement \u03b4, the axial elongation of the slanted wire is **\u0394L_slant = \u03b4\u22c5cos(\u03b8)**.\n    *   The original length of the middle wire is L_mid. Let's call this H. The original length of the slanted wires is L_slant = H / cos(\u03b8).\n    *   The tension in a wire is given by T = (AE/L\u2080)\u22c5\u0394L.\n        *   T_mid = (AE / L_mid)\u22c5\u0394L_mid = (AE / H)\u22c5\u03b4\n        *   T_slant = (AE / L_slant)\u22c5\u0394L_slant = (AE / (H/cos(\u03b8)))\u22c5(\u03b4\u22c5cos(\u03b8)) = (AE/H)\u22c5cos\u00b2(\u03b8)\u22c5\u03b4\n    *   By comparing the two tension expressions, we find the compatibility relation:\n        **T_slant = T_mid \u22c5 cos\u00b2(\u03b8)**\n\n3.  **Failure Analysis:**\n    *   Since 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < 90\u00b0, cos(\u03b8) is between 0 and 1, which means cos\u00b2(\u03b8) is also between 0 and 1.\n    *   From the compatibility relation, T_slant \u2264 T_mid.\n    *   This means the tension in the middle wire is always greater than or equal to the tension in the slanted wires.\n    *   Therefore, as load P increases, the **middle wire will always fail first** (unless \u03b8=0), reaching its breaking strength of 800 N.\n    *   Failure occurs when **T_mid = 800 N**.\n    *   At this point, the tension in the slanted wires is T_slant = 800 \u22c5 cos\u00b2(\u03b8).\n    *   Now we can find the failure load, P_fail, by substituting these tensions into the equilibrium equation:\n        P_fail(\u03b8) = T_mid + 2\u22c5T_slant\u22c5cos(\u03b8)\n        P_fail(\u03b8) = 800 + 2 \u22c5 (800\u22c5cos\u00b2(\u03b8)) \u22c5 cos(\u03b8)\n        **P_fail(\u03b8) = 800(1 + 2cos\u00b3(\u03b8))**\n\n---\n\n**Part 1: Plot Relationship between \u03b8 and Failure Load P**\n\nWe use the equation P_fail(\u03b8) = 800(1 + 2cos\u00b3(\u03b8)) for 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < 90\u00b0.\n\n**Table of Values:**\n\n| \u03b8 (degrees) | cos(\u03b8) | cos\u00b3(\u03b8) | P_fail (N) |\n| :---------- | :------- | :-------- | :--------- |\n| 0           | 1.0000   | 1.0000    | 2400       |\n| 10          | 0.9848   | 0.9554    | 2329       |\n| 20          | 0.9397   | 0.8299    | 2128       |\n| 30          | 0.8660   | 0.6495    | 1839       |\n| 40          | 0.7660   | 0.4495    | 1519       |\n| 50          | 0.6428   | 0.2656    | 1225       |\n| 60          | 0.5000   | 0.1250    | 1000       |\n| 70          | 0.3420   | 0.0401    | 864        |\n| 80          | 0.1736   | 0.0052    | 808        |\n| 89          | 0.0175   | 0.000005  | \u2248 800      |\n\n**Plot:** The relationship is a curve that starts at P = 2400 N when \u03b8 = 0\u00b0 and decreases as \u03b8 increases. As \u03b8 approaches 90\u00b0, the contribution from the slanted wires becomes negligible, and the failure load P approaches the strength of the middle wire alone, 800 N.\n\n*(A plot would show \u03b8 on the x-axis from 0 to 90\u00b0 and P_fail on the y-axis from 800 to 2400 N, with the curve following the points calculated above.)*\n\n---\n\n**Part 2: Value of \u03b8 for Simultaneous Failure**\n\nFor all three wires to fail simultaneously, the tension in every wire must be 800 N at the moment of failure.\nT_mid = 800 N\nT_slant = 800 N\n\nUsing the compatibility relation we derived:\nT_slant = T_mid \u22c5 cos\u00b2(\u03b8)\n800 = 800 \u22c5 cos\u00b2(\u03b8)\n1 = cos\u00b2(\u03b8)\n\nTaking the square root of both sides (and knowing \u03b8 is acute, so cos(\u03b8) is positive):\ncos(\u03b8) = 1\n\u03b8 = arccos(1)\n**\u03b8 = 0\u00b0**\n\n**Answer:**\nThe relationship between failure load and angle is given by the function **P_fail(\u03b8) = 800(1 + 2cos\u00b3(\u03b8))**.\nAll three wires will fail simultaneously when **\u03b8 = 0\u00b0**. At this angle, all three wires are vertical and parallel, and they share the load based on their stiffness and elongation. Our compatibility analysis shows that at \u03b8 = 0\u00b0, their tensions will be equal, leading to simultaneous failure. The failure load at this angle is P = 3 \u00d7 800 N = 2400 N.",
