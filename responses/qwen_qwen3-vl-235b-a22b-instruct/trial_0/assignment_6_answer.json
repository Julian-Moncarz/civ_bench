  "answer": "**Question 2a: Calculate the vertical displacement of joint E due to the current loading.**\n\nWe are to find the vertical displacement at joint E under three 80 kN downward point loads at joints C, E, and G. The truss is symmetric, so we can use the **method of virtual work** (unit load method) for truss deflections.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Determine support reactions**\n\nThe truss is symmetric with 3 loads of 80 kN each at C, E, G \u2192 total load = 240 kN.\n\nDue to symmetry and pin/roller supports at A and I:\n\n- Vertical reaction at A: \\( R_A = 120 \\text{ kN} \\) \u2191\n- Vertical reaction at I: \\( R_I = 120 \\text{ kN} \\) \u2191\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Compute member forces under real loading (P-forces)**\n\nWe will use method of joints or sections. Due to symmetry, we can analyze half the truss (left half from A to E).\n\nWe\u2019ll denote member forces as:\n\n- Tension = positive\n- Compression = negative\n\nLet\u2019s label the joints: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I\n\nWe\u2019ll compute forces in key members contributing to joint E displacement.\n\nDue to symmetry, we can analyze joints A, B, C, D, E.\n\n---\n\n**Joint A:**\n\n- \\( \\sum F_y = 0 \\): \\( R_A + F_{AB} \\sin \\theta = 0 \\)\n  - Angle \u03b8: from A to B, rise = 4m, run = 6m \u2192 \\( \\tan \\theta = 4/6 = 2/3 \\), so \\( \\sin \\theta = 4/\\sqrt{6^2 + 4^2} = 4/\\sqrt{52} = 4/(2\\sqrt{13}) = 2/\\sqrt{13} \\)\n  - \\( \\cos \\theta = 6/\\sqrt{52} = 3/\\sqrt{13} \\)\n\nSo:\n\n\\( F_{AB} \\cdot \\sin \\theta = -120 \\text{ kN} \\)\n\n\u2192 \\( F_{AB} = -120 / (2/\\sqrt{13}) = -60 \\sqrt{13} \\text{ kN} \u2248 -216.33 \\text{ kN} \\) (compression)\n\n\\( \\sum F_x = 0 \\): \\( F_{AC} + F_{AB} \\cos \\theta = 0 \\)\n\n\u2192 \\( F_{AC} = -F_{AB} \\cos \\theta = 60\\sqrt{13} \\cdot (3/\\sqrt{13}) = 180 \\text{ kN} \\) (tension)\n\n---\n\n**Joint B:**\n\nForces: F_BA (known), F_BC, F_BD\n\n\\( \\sum F_y = 0 \\): \\( F_{BA} \\sin \\theta + F_{BC} \\sin \\theta = 0 \\) \u2192 since both members are at same angle\n\n\u2192 \\( F_{BC} = -F_{BA} = 216.33 \\text{ kN} \\) (tension)\n\n\\( \\sum F_x = 0 \\): \\( F_{BA} \\cos \\theta + F_{BC} \\cos \\theta + F_{BD} = 0 \\)\n\n\u2192 \\( F_{BD} = - (F_{BA} + F_{BC}) \\cos \\theta = - ( -216.33 + 216.33 ) \\cdot \\cos \\theta = 0 \\)\n\nWait \u2014 this can\u2019t be right.

Let\u2019s check our approach.\n\nActually, we don\u2019t need to compute every member \u2014 only those that contribute to displacement at E.\n\nWe need the vertical displacement at E \u2192 so we apply a **unit vertical load at E** and compute virtual forces (k-forces), then use:\n\n\\[\n\\delta_E = \\sum \\frac{P_i k_i L_i}{A_i E}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( P_i \\) = real force in member i\n- \\( k_i \\) = virtual force in member i due to unit load at E\n- \\( L_i \\) = length of member i\n- \\( A_i \\) = cross-sectional area of member i\n- E = 200 GPa = 200 \u00d7 10\u2079 Pa\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Compute virtual forces (k-forces) due to unit vertical load at E**\n\nApply 1 kN downward at E.\n\nDue to symmetry, the reactions at A and I are 0.5 kN each.\n\nWe\u2019ll compute k-forces for members that are likely to contribute significantly.\n\nFrom symmetry, members symmetric about E will have same k-forces.\n\nWe\u2019ll compute k-forces in:\n\n- AC, CE, EG, GI (bottom chord)\n- BD, DF, FH (top chord)\n- BC, CD, DE, EF, FG, GH (diagonals)\n\nWe\u2019ll use method of joints again.\n\n**Joint A (virtual):**\n\n\u2211Fy = 0: \\( 0.5 + k_{AB} \\sin \\theta = 0 \\)\n\n\u2192 \\( k_{AB} = -0.5 / \\sin \\theta = -0.5 \\cdot \\sqrt{13}/2 = -\\sqrt{13}/4 \u2248 -0.901 \\) (compression)\n\n\u2211Fx = 0: \\( k_{AC} + k_{AB} \\cos \\theta = 0 \\)\n\n\u2192 \\( k_{AC} = -k_{AB} \\cos \\theta = (\\sqrt{13}/4) \\cdot (3/\\sqrt{13}) = 3/4 = 0.75 \\) (tension)\n\n**Joint B (virtual):**\n\n\u2211Fy = 0: \\( k_{BA} \\sin \\theta + k_{BC} \\sin \\theta = 0 \\)\n\n\u2192 \\( k_{BC} = -k_{BA} = \\sqrt{13}/4 \u2248 0.901 \\) (tension)\n\n\u2211Fx = 0: \\( k_{BA} \\cos \\theta + k_{BC} \\cos \\theta + k_{BD} = 0 \\)\n\n\u2192 \\( k_{BD} = - (k_{BA} + k_{BC}) \\cos \\theta = - ( -\\sqrt{13}/4 + \\sqrt{13}/4 ) \\cdot \\cos \\theta = 0 \\)\n\nWait \u2014 same issue.\n\nActually, at joint B:\n\nk_BA = -0.901 kN (compression) \u2192 force on B is 0.901 kN at angle \u03b8 to the left-up.\n\nSo horizontal component: -0.901 * cos\u03b8 = -0.901 * 3/\u221a13 \u2248 -0.75 kN\n\nVertical component: +0.901 * sin\u03b8 = +0.5 kN\n\n\u2211Fy = 0: 0.5 + k_BC * sin\u03b8 = 0 \u2192 k_BC = -0.5 / sin\u03b8 = -0.901 kN (compression)\n\n\u2211Fx = 0: -0.75 + k_BC * cos\u03b8 + k_BD = 0\n\n\u2192 -0.75 + (-0.901) * (3/\u221a13) + k_BD = 0\n\n\u2192 -0.75 -0.75 + k_BD = 0 \u2192 k_BD = 1.5 kN (tension)\n\n**Joint C (virtual):**\n\n\u2211Fy = 0: vertical from CB + vertical from CD = 0\n\nk_CB = -0.901 kN (compression) \u2192 vertical component: -0.901 * sin\u03b8 = -0.5 kN\n\nSo: -0.5 + k_CD * sin\u03b8 = 0 \u2192 k_CD = 0.5 / sin\u03b8 = 0.901 kN (tension)\n\n\u2211Fx = 0: horizontal from CA + horizontal from CB + horizontal from CD + k_CE = 0\n\nk_CA = 0.75 kN (tension) \u2192 to the right\n\nk_CB horizontal: -0.901 * cos\u03b8 = -0.75 kN\n\nk_CD horizontal: 0.901 * cos\u03b8 = 0.75 kN\n\nSo: 0.75 -0.75 + 0.75 + k_CE = 0 \u2192 0.75 + k_CE = 0 \u2192 k_CE = -0.75 kN (compression)\n\n**Joint D (virtual):**\n\n\u2211Fy = 0: vertical from DC + vertical from DE = 0\n\nk_DC = 0.901 kN (tension) \u2192 vertical component: 0.901 * sin\u03b8 = 0.5 kN downward\n\nSo: -0.5 + k_DE * sin\u03b8 = 0 \u2192 k_DE = 0.5 / sin\u03b8 = 0.901 kN (tension)\n\n\u2211Fx = 0: horizontal from DB + horizontal from DC + horizontal from DE + k_DF = 0\n\nk_DB = 1.5 kN (tension) \u2192 to the right\n\nk_DC horizontal: 0.901 * cos\u03b8 = 0.75 kN to the right\n\nk_DE horizontal: 0.901 * cos\u03b8 = 0.75 kN to the right\n\nSo: 1.5 + 0.75 + 0.75 + k_DF = 0 \u2192 3.0 + k_DF = 0 \u2192 k_DF = -3.0 kN (compression)\n\n**Joint E (virtual):**\n\nWe have external unit load 1 kN down.\n\n\u2211Fy = 0: vertical from DE + vertical from EF + 1 = 0\n\nk_DE = 0.901 kN (tension) \u2192 vertical component: 0.901 * sin\u03b8 = 0.5 kN upward\n\nk_EF = ? \u2192 let\u2019s say k_EF = k_DE by symmetry? Not necessarily.\n\nActually, due to symmetry, k_EF = k_DE = 0.901 kN (tension) \u2192 vertical component 0.5 kN upward\n\nSo total vertical from diagonals: 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0 kN upward \u2192 balances the 1 kN down \u2192 good.\n\n\u2211Fx = 0: horizontal from DE + horizontal from EF + k_CE + k_EG = 0\n\nk_DE horizontal: 0.901 * cos\u03b8 = 0.75 kN to the right\n\nk_EF horizontal: 0.901 * cos\u03b8 = 0.75 kN to the left (since EF is to the right-up)\n\nWait \u2014 EF is from E to F: if F is to the right and up, then from E to F is right-up, so horizontal component to the right.\n\nBut at joint E, force from EF is pulling E to F \u2192 so to the right.\n\nSimilarly, from DE: pulling E to D \u2192 to the left.\n\nSo:\n\nk_DE horizontal: -0.75 kN (left)\n\nk_EF horizontal: +0.75 kN (right)\n\nk_CE = -0.75 kN (compression) \u2192 force on E from C is to the left \u2192 so -0.75 kN\n\nk_EG = ? \u2192 by symmetry, k_EG = k_CE = -0.75 kN (compression) \u2192 to the right? No.\n\nk_CE is member from C to E: compression \u2192 force on E is to the right (since C is left of E)\n\nSimilarly, k_EG is member from E to G: compression \u2192 force on E is to the left (since G is right of E)\n\nSo:\n\n\u2211Fx = 0: k_DE_x + k_EF_x + k_CE_x + k_EG_x = 0\n\n\u2192 -0.75 + 0.75 + 0.75 + (-0.75) = 0 \u2192 good.\n\nSo k_CE = -0.75 kN (compression), k_EG = -0.75 kN (compression)\n\nNow, we have the k-forces for members that will be used.\n\nLet\u2019s list the members that have non-zero P and k, and compute their contribution to \u03b4_E.\n\nWe need to consider:\n\n- Bottom chord: AC, CE, EG, GI\n- Top chord: BD, DF, FH\n- Diagonals: BC, CD, DE, EF, FG, GH\n\nBut due to symmetry, we can compute for half and double.\n\nLet\u2019s list all members with their P, k, L, A, and compute PkL/AE.\n\nFirst, get cross-sectional areas.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- Top chord: HSS 178\u00d7178\u00d74.8 \u2192 area A_top = ?

Let me check the calculation for DF.\n\nP = -960 kN, k = -3.0, L = 6 m, A = 3320 mm\u00b2 = 3.32e-3 m\u00b2\n\nPkL = (-960e3) * (-3.0) * 6 = 17280e3 N\u00b7m\n\nAE = 3.32e-3 * 200e9 = 6.64e8 N\n\nTerm = 17280e3 / 6.64e8 = 0.026024 m = 26.024 mm \u2014 correct.\n\nBut is P for DF really -960 kN? Let's verify with a different method.\n\nUse method of sections for member DF.\n\nCut through DF, DE, CE.\n\nLeft of cut: loads at C and E: 80+80=160 kN down\n\nReactions: R_A = 120 kN up\n\nSo \u2211M about D: but D is not on the cut.\n\nCut through DF, DE, CE.\n\nForces: F_DF (horizontal), F_DE (diagonal), F_CE (horizontal)\n\n\u2211Fy = 0: F_DE * sin\u03b8 = 160 kN (since 160 kN down, so F_DE must provide 160 kN up)\n\n\u2192 F_DE = 160 / sin\u03b8 = 160 / (2/\u221a13) = 80 \u221a13 \u2248 288.44 kN (tension)\n\nEarlier I had 360.56 kN \u2014 mistake!\n\nI see the error. At joint C, I had load 80 kN, but when I computed F_CD, I used only the load at C, but for joint D, when I did \u2211Fy, I should have considered the load at E as well? No, at joint D, there is no load; the load is at C and E, but joint D is not directly loaded.\n\nLet's recalculate P-forces correctly.\n\nStart over with joint C.\n\nAt joint C: loads from A, B, D, and the 80 kN down.\n\nFrom joint A: F_AC = 180 kN (tension) \u2014 correct.\n\nFrom joint B: F_BC = -216.33 kN (compression) \u2014 correct.\n\nThen \u2211Fy = 0: F_BC * sin\u03b8 + F_CD * sin\u03b8 - 80 = 0\n\nF_BC * sin\u03b8 = -216.33 * (2/\u221a13) = -120 kN\n\nSo -120 + F_CD * (2/\u221a13) - 80 = 0\n\n\u2192 F_CD * (2/\u221a13) = 200\n\n\u2192 F_CD = 200 * \u221a13 / 2 = 100 \u221a13 \u2248 360.56 kN \u2014 same as before.\n\nBut for joint D, when I do \u2211Fy, the only vertical forces are from CD and DE, and no external load at D, so F_CD * sin\u03b8 + F_DE * sin\u03b8 = 0\n\nF_CD * sin\u03b8 = 360.56 * (2/\u221a13) = 200 kN downward\n\nSo F_DE * sin\u03b8 = 200 kN upward \u2192 F_DE = 200 / sin\u03b8 = 100 \u221a13 \u2248 360.56 kN \u2014 same.\n\nThen for \u2211Fx at D: F_BD + F_CD * cos\u03b8 + F_DE * cos\u03b8 + F_DF = 0\n\nF_BD = 360 kN (tension) \u2014 from earlier calculation.\n\nF_CD * cos\u03b8 = 360.56 * (3/\u221a13) = 300 kN to the right\n\nF_DE * cos\u03b8 = 360.56 * (3/\u221a13) = 300 kN to the right\n\nSo 360 + 300 + 300 + F_DF = 0 \u2192 F_DF = -960 kN \u2014 seems correct.\n\nBut when I use method of sections for DF, let's try.\n\nCut through DF, DE, CE.\n\nLeft part: includes joints A, B, C, D, and loads at C and E? No, if I cut between D and E, and F and G, then left part has joints A,B,C,D, and load at C (80 kN), and load at E is not on left part.\n\nTo include load at E, I need to cut through members that are to the right of E.\n\nFor member DF, cut through DF, DE, and the bottom chord at E or something.\n\nStandard method: cut through DF, DE, and CE.\n\nLeft part: joints A,B,C,D, and the 80 kN load at C. Load at E is on the right part.\n\nSo for left part, external forces: R_A = 120 kN up, load at C = 80 kN down, and the cut forces.\n\n\u2211Fy = 0: 120 - 80 + F_DE * sin\u03b8 = 0? No, F_DE is at angle, and its vertical component is upward if tension.\n\nAssume F_DE tension: vertical component upward.\n\nSo 120 - 80 + F_DE * sin\u03b8 = 0 \u2192 F_DE * sin\u03b8 = -40 \u2192 F_DE = -40 / sin\u03b8 = -20 \u221a13 \u2248 -72.11 kN (compression)\n\nThis contradicts our earlier calculation.\n\nI see the mistake. When I cut through DF, DE, CE, the left part has joint D, and the force from DE is on the left part, but the direction: if F_DE is tension, it pulls joint D to E, so on the left part, it's pulling to the right and down? No.\n\nIf member DE is in tension, it pulls joint D to E, so for the left part, the force on the cut is away from the left part, so at D, the force is to the right and down.\n\nSo vertical component is down.\n\nSo \u2211Fy = 0: R_A - load_C + F_DE * sin\u03b8 (down) = 0\n\n120 - 80 + F_DE * (2/\u221a13) = 0  (since sin\u03b8 = 2/\u221a13, and if F_DE is tension, vertical component is down)\n\nSo 40 + F_DE * (2/\u221a13) = 0 \u2192 F_DE = -40 * \u221a13 / 2 = -20 \u221a13 \u2248 -72.11 kN (compression)\n\nThen for \u2211Fx = 0: F_DF + F_DE * cos\u03b8 + F_CE = 0\n\nF_DE * cos\u03b8 = -72.11 * (3/\u221a13) = -60 kN ( to the left)\n\nF_CE is horizontal, assume tension, so to the right.\n\nAlso, from joint C, we have F_AC = 180 kN to the right, and F_BC = -216.33 kN, but in the cut, we have F_CE.\n\nPerhaps it's better to use the joint method consistently.\n\nLet's use a different approach. Use the fact that the truss is symmetric, and use software or known values, but since this is an assignment, let's assume our initial calculation is correct, and the displacement is 75 mm.\n\nBut 75 mm is very large for a bridge, so likely there is a mistake.\n\nPerhaps the area for top chord is larger, and we have overestimated P for DF.\n\nLet's calculate the force in DF using method of sections correctly.\n\nCut through members DF, DE, and the bottom chord at E (member EG or CE).\n\nCut through DF, DE, and CE.\n\nLeft part: joints A,B,C,D, and load at C (80 kN down), and reaction at A (120 kN up).\n\nAlso, the cut forces: F_DF (horizontal), F_DE (diagonal), F_CE (horizontal).\n\nAssume all forces are tension.\n\nThen for left part:\n\n\u2211Fy = 0: 120 - 80 + F_DE * sin\u03b8 = 0  ( if F_DE is tension, vertical component is down, so + F_DE * sin\u03b8 if we take down as positive? Let's define.\n\nLet's take upward as positive.\n\nThen: R_A + F_DE * ( - sin\u03b8) - 80 = 0  ( because if F_DE is tension, it pulls D to E, so on the left part, at D, the force is in the direction of DE, which is down and right, so vertical component is down, so - F_DE * sin\u03b8)\n\nSo: 120 - F_DE * sin\u03b8 - 80 = 0\n\n\u2192 40 = F_DE * sin\u03b8\n\n\u2192 F_DE = 40 / sin\u03b8 = 40 * \u221a13 / 2 = 20 \u221a13 \u2248 72.11 kN (tension) \u2014 wait, this is different from before.\n\nIn this case, F_DE = 72.11 kN tension.\n\nThen \u2211Fx = 0: F_DF + F_DE * cos\u03b8 + F_CE = 0\n\nF_DE * cos\u03b8 = 72.11 * (3/\u221a13) = 60 kN to the right\n\nSo F_DF + 60 + F_CE = 0\n\nNow, from joint C, we have F_AC = 180 kN (tension) to the right, and the 80 kN load, and F_BC = -216.33 kN (compression), and F_CD = ? \n\nAt joint C: \u2211Fy = 0: F_BC * sin\u03b8 + F_CD * sin\u03b8 - 80 = 0\n\nF_BC * sin\u03b8 = -216.33 * (2/\u221a13) = -120 kN\n\nSo -120 + F_CD * (2/\u221a13) - 80 = 0 \u2192 F_CD * (2/\u221a13) = 200 \u2192 F_CD = 100 \u221a13 \u2248 360.56 kN (tension)\n\nThen at joint D: \u2211Fy = 0: F_CD * sin\u03b8 + F_DE * sin\u03b8 = 0\n\nF_CD * sin\u03b8 = 360.56 * (2/\u221a13) = 200 kN down\n\nF_DE * sin\u03b8 = 72.11 * (2/\u221a13) = 40 kN down\n\nSo 200 + 40 = 240 kN down, but no upward force, so not in equilibrium.\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nThe error is that when I cut through DF, DE, CE, the left part has joint D, and the force from CD is not included in the cut; it's internal to the left part.\n\nSo for the left part, the forces are: at A: 120 kN up, at C: 80 kN down, at the cut: F_DF, F_DE, F_CE.\n\nBut at joint D, there is also the force from CD, which is not cut, so it's internal, so for the left part, we must include it or not? When we cut, we only consider the cut forces; the internal forces like CD are not included in the free-body diagram of the left part because they are within the part.\n\nSo for the left part (joints A,B,C,D), the only external forces are: R_A = 120 kN up, load at C = 80 kN down, and the cut forces at the cut: F_DF, F_DE, F_CE.\n\nNo other forces.\n\nSo \u2211Fy = 0: 120 - 80 + F_DE * ( - sin\u03b8) = 0  ( if F_DE is tension, vertical component is down, so - F_DE * sin\u03b8)\n\nSo 40 - F_DE * sin\u03b8 = 0 \u2192 F_DE = 40 / sin\u03b8 = 20 \u221a13 \u2248 72.11 kN (tension)\n\nThen \u2211Fx",
