  "answer": "**Question 4a: Sketch the bending moment diagram (kN\u00b7m) for the top beam (beam DAE), now straight and elastically recovered. Label important values.**\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Understand the system**\n\nBeam DAE is supported at D and E, with a central jack force \\( P_j = 22 \\text{ kN} \\) acting upward at point B (midspan). The beam is symmetric, total span = 0.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 0.5 = 6.0 m. Jack is located at center \u2014 so 3.0 m from each end.\n\nThe beam has uniform mass: 1,168 kg \u2192 weight = \\( W = mg = 1168 \\times 9.81 = 11,458.08 \\text{ N} \u2248 11.46 \\text{ kN} \\).\n\nDistributed load: \\( w = \\frac{11.46 \\text{ kN}}{6.0 \\text{ m}} = 1.91 \\text{ kN/m} \\).\n\nSupport reactions at D and E are equal due to symmetry. Let\u2019s compute them.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Compute reactions at D and E**\n\nTotal downward load = distributed load + no other vertical loads (jack is internal to system but acts upward on the beam \u2014 wait! Clarification needed.)\n\nActually, **the jack applies an upward force at B on the beam**, so this is an *external* upward force on the beam DAE.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Downward: distributed load = 11.46 kN\n- Upward: jack force \\( P_j = 22 \\text{ kN} \\) at midspan\n\nWait \u2014 this would imply net upward force? That can\u2019t be right unless supports also provide downward reaction? But physically, the jack pushes up on the beam, and the beam is held down at D and E by cables or supports.\n\nActually, rereading: \u201cWhen hydraulic oil is pumped into the jack, the internal piston will push upon each beam and experience an axial compressive force of \\( P_j \\).\u201d So the jack pushes *upward* on beam DAE (at B), and *downward* on the bottom beam (not our concern for part a).\n\nSo for beam DAE:\n\n- It has its own weight (11.46 kN, uniformly distributed)\n- It has an upward point load of 22 kN at midspan (from jack)\n- It is simply supported at D and E.\n\nThis means the beam is being lifted at midspan \u2014 so reactions at D and E must be *downward* to balance the system? No \u2014 that contradicts statics.\n\nActually, in reality, if you push up on a simply supported beam at midspan with a force greater than half the total weight, the beam would lift off the supports \u2014 which doesn\u2019t make physical sense unless the supports are pulling down (e.g., via cables).\n\nAh \u2014 here\u2019s the key: the problem says \u201cAt the ends of each beam, there is an arrangement of wooden bearing plates and five closed loops of high-alloy steel cables.\u201d So the beam is not just sitting on supports \u2014 it is *held down* by cables. So the supports at D and E can exert *downward* forces (tension in cables).\n\nSo we treat D and E as supports that can provide *downward* reactions \u2014 i.e., the beam is \u201changing\u201d or restrained by cables, so reactions can be negative (downward).\n\nLet\u2019s proceed with equilibrium.\n\nLet \\( R_D \\) and \\( R_E \\) be the vertical reactions at D and E, positive upward.\n\nSum of vertical forces:\n\n\\[\nR_D + R_E - 11.46 + 22 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad R_D + R_E = -10.54 \\text{ kN}\n\\]\n\nBy symmetry, \\( R_D = R_E = -5.27 \\text{ kN} \\)\n\nNegative sign means the reactions are *downward* \u2014 which makes sense because the jack is pushing up harder than the beam\u2019s weight, so the cables at ends must pull down to keep the beam in place.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Construct bending moment diagram**\n\nWe\u2019ll compute bending moment along the beam.\n\nDefine coordinate x from left end D (x=0) to right end E (x=6.0 m).\n\nThe distributed load is 1.91 kN/m downward.\n\nJack force 22 kN upward at x = 3.0 m.\n\nReactions: R_D = R_E = -5.27 kN (downward).\n\nNow, bending moment M(x):\n\nFor 0 \u2264 x \u2264 3.0 m:\n\n\\[\nM(x) = R_D \\cdot x + \\left( -\\frac{w x^2}{2} \\right) \n\\]\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s define sign convention: positive bending moment causes compression on top (sagging).\n\nBut since the jack is pushing up, and reactions are down, the beam will have a \"hump\" \u2014 concave down? Wait, actually, with upward force at center and downward reactions at ends, the beam will deflect upward at center \u2014 so bending moment will be *negative* (hogging) near center? Let\u2019s compute carefully.\n\nStandard: take clockwise moments as positive for cut sections.\n\nConsider a section at distance x from D.\n\nLeft of jack (x < 3.0):\n\nShear force V(x) = R_D - w x = -5.27 - 1.91x\n\nBending moment M(x) = R_D * x - w * x * (x/2) = -5.27x - (1.91 x\u00b2)/2\n\nAt x=0: M=0\n\nAt x=3.0: M = -5.27*3 - (1.91*9)/2 = -15.81 - 8.595 = -24.405 kN\u00b7m\n\nAt x=3.0+, just right of jack, we add the upward jack force:\n\nV(x) = R_D - w x + 22 = -5.27 -1.91x + 22 = 16.73 - 1.91x\n\nM(x) = R_D * x - w * x\u00b2 / 2 + 22*(x - 3)\n\nAt x=3: M = -5.27*3 - 1.91*9/2 + 0 = -24.405 kN\u00b7m (same as left)\n\nAt x=6.0: M = -5.27*6 - 1.91*36/2 + 22*(3) = -31.62 - 34.38 + 66 = 0 \u2713\n\nCheck symmetry: at x=3, M=-24.405 kN\u00b7m; at x=0 and x=6, M=0.\n\nSo bending moment diagram is parabolic, symmetric, minimum (most negative) at center.\n\nMaximum magnitude of bending moment is 24.405 kN\u00b7m at midspan.\n\nSince the beam is symmetric and loaded symmetrically, BMD is symmetric.\n\n---\n\n**Sketch description:**\n\n- Horizontal axis: length of beam from D to E (0 to 6.0 m)\n- Vertical axis: bending moment (kN\u00b7m)\n- Parabolic curve starting at 0 at D, decreasing to -24.4 kN\u00b7m at midspan (x=3.0 m), then increasing back to 0 at E.\n- Label: at x=3.0 m, M = -24.4 kN\u00b7m\n- Shape: downward parabola (concave down) \u2014 hogging moment.\n\nNote: In some conventions, hogging is negative, sagging positive. Here, since the beam is being pushed up at center, it's hogging \u2014 so negative moment.\n\n**Answer 4a:**\n> The bending moment diagram for beam DAE is a symmetric parabola with zero moment at supports D and E, and a maximum magnitude (minimum value) of **-24.4 kN\u00b7m** at midspan (point B). The diagram is concave down, indicating hogging moment.\n\n---\n\n**Question 4b: Determine the maximum allowable jack force \\( P_{j,\\max} \\) and the minimum allowable cable diameter \\( d_{\\min} \\) that will not cause yielding in neither beam nor any cables.**\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Yielding condition for the beam**\n\nThe beam cross-section (Figure 2) is I-shaped.\n\nDimensions:\n- Flange width = 327 mm\n- Flange thickness = 24 mm (both top and bottom)\n- Web height = 622 - 2*24 = 574 mm\n- Web thickness = 15.4 mm\n\nFirst, compute section properties.\n\n**Neutral axis:** Due to symmetry, NA is at midheight.\n\nTotal depth h = 622 mm.\n\nMoment of inertia I about NA:\n\nI = I_flanges + I_web\n\nEach flange: area A_f = 327 * 24 = 7848 mm\u00b2\n\nDistance from NA to flange centroid: y_f = (622/2) - 24/2 = 311 - 12 = 299 mm\n\nI_flange (one) = I_c + A d\u00b2 = (b t\u00b3)/12 + A y\u00b2\n\nBut since flange is thin, often approximate by A y\u00b2, but better to compute exactly.\n\nActually, for flange:\n\nI_flange = (1/12)*b*t\u00b3 + b*t*(y_f)^2\n\nSimilarly for web.\n\nCompute:\n\nFlange (each):\n\nI_f = (1/12)*327*(24)^3 + 327*24*(299)^2\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n24\u00b3 = 13824\n\n(1/12)*327*13824 = 327 * 1152 = 376,704 mm\u2074\n\nA*y\u00b2 = 327*24*(299)^2 = 7848 * 89401 = ?\n\nFirst, 299\u00b2 = (300-1)^2 = 90000 - 600 + 1 = 89401\n\nSo A*y\u00b2 = 7848 * 89401\n\nCalculate:\n\n7848 * 89401 = 7848 * (90000 - 599) = 7848*90000 - 7848*599\n\n7848*90000 = 706,320,000\n\n7848*600 = 4,708,800 minus 7848*1 = 7848 \u2192 so 7848*599 = 4,708,800 - 7848 = 4,700,952\n\nThus A*y\u00b2 = 706,320,000 - 4,700,952 = 701,619,048 mm\u2074\n\nThat can't be right \u2014 units: mm\u2074, but 701 million mm\u2074? Let me check.\n\nActually, 7848 mm\u00b2 * 89401 mm\u00b2 = 7848 * 89401 mm\u2074\n\n7848 * 89401:\n\nBetter: 7848 * 89401 = ?\n\nUse calculator approximation:\n\n7848 * 89401 \u2248 7848 * 8.9401e4 = 7.016e8 mm\u2074 \u2014 yes, 701.6 million mm\u2074\n\nBut this is for one flange? And we have two flanges.\n\nBut also, the term (1/12)*b*t\u00b3 is negligible: 376,704 mm\u2074 vs 701,619,048 \u2014 so indeed negligible.\n\nSo I_flange_total \u2248 2 * [A*y\u00b2] = 2 * 701,619,048 = 1,403,238,096 mm\u2074\n\nNow web:\n\nWeb area A_w = 574 * 15.4 = 8839.6 mm\u00b2\n\nCentroid at NA, so y=0, so I_web = (1/12)*b*h\u00b3 = (1/12)*15.4*(574)^3\n\nCompute 574\u00b2 = 329,476\n\n574\u00b3 = 574 * 329,476 = let's compute:\n\n500*329476 = 164,738,000\n\n74*329476 = 70*329476=23,063,320; 4*329476=1,317,904 \u2192 total 24,381,224\n\nTotal 164,738,000 + 24,381,224 = 189,119,224\n\nThen I_web = (1/12)*15.4*189,119,224\n\nFirst, 15.4 * 189,119,224 = 15.4 * 1.89119224e8 \u2248 2.912e9\n\nDivide by 12: \u2248 242,700,000 mm\u2074\n\nMore accurately:\n\n15.4 * 189,119,224 = 15.4 * 189119224\n\n= (15 + 0.4)*189119224 = 15*189119224 = 2,836,788,360; 0.4*189119224=75,647,689.6 \u2192 total 2,912,436,049.6\n\nDivide by 12: 242,703,004.13 mm\u2074\n\nSo I_total = I_flanges + I_web \u2248 1,403,238,096 + 242,703,004 = 1,645,941,100 mm\u2074\n\n\u2248 1.646 \u00d7 10\u2079 mm\u2074\n\nWe can write as I = 1646 \u00d7 10\u2076 mm\u2074\n\n---\n\n**Section modulus Z = I / y_max**\n\ny_max = distance from NA to extreme fiber = 622/2 = 311 mm\n\nZ = I / y_max = 1.646e9 / 311 \u2248 5,292,604 mm\u00b3 \u2248 5.293 \u00d7 10\u2076 mm\u00b3\n\n---\n\n**Yield stress \u03c3_y = 400 MPa**\n\nMaximum bending moment before yielding: M_max = \u03c3_y * Z = 400 * 5.293e6 N\u00b7mm = 400 * 5.293e6 / 1000 kN\u00b7m = 400 * 5.293 = 2117.2 kN\u00b7m? That can't be right.\n\nUnits:\n\n\u03c3_y = 400 N/mm\u00b2\n\nZ = 5.293e6 mm\u00b3\n\nM = \u03c3_y * Z = 400 * 5.293e6 = 2.1172e9 N\u00b7mm = 2117.2 kN\u00b7m\n\nBut earlier with P_j=22kN, we had M=24.4 kN\u00b7m \u2014 so beam can handle much more.\n\nBut wait \u2014 this is the moment capacity, but in our case, the moment is caused by the jack force and distributed load.\n\nIn part b, we need to find P_j,max such that the bending moment does not exceed M_yield = 2117.2 kN\u00b7m.\n\nBut also, the cables must not yield.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Free-body diagrams**\n\nAs hinted, draw two FBDs: one for the beam, one for the cable system.\n\nActually, since the cables are at the ends, and each end has five loops, we need to consider the tension in each cable.\n\nFirst, for the beam DAE:\n\nIt is simply supported at D and E, with distributed load w = 1.91 kN/m, and upward jack force P_j at midspan.\n\nReactions at D and E: as before, R_D = R_E = (wL - P_j)/2 ? Earlier we had:\n\nSum F_y: R_D + R_E = wL - P_j\n\nWith wL = 11.46 kN, P_j upward, so R_D + R_E = 11.46 - P_j\n\nBy symmetry, R_D = R_E = (11.46 - P_j)/2\n\nThese reactions are upward if positive, but if P_j > 11.46, they become negative (downward), meaning cables are in tension.\n\nThe bending moment at midspan is maximum.\n\nFrom earlier calculation, at midspan, M = R_D * (L/2) - w*(L/2)*(L/4) + 0 (since jack is at midspan, no moment arm)\n\nActually, standard formula for simply supported beam with central point load and uniform load.\n\nM_mid = (P_j * L)/4 - (w L\u00b2)/8\n\nBecause:\n\n- Point load P_j at center: M = P_j L / 4\n- Uniform load: M = w L\u00b2 / 8 (sagging, positive)\n- But here, P_j is upward, so it reduces the sagging moment.\n\nIn our sign convention, if we take sagging as positive, then:\n\nM_mid = - (w L\u00b2)/8 + (P_j L)/4\n\nBecause uniform load causes sagging (positive), jack upward causes hogging (negative).\n\nEarlier when P_j=22, wL=11.46, L=6, we computed M=-24.4 kN\u00b7m\n\nCompute with formula:\n\nM_mid = - (1.91 * 36)/8 + (22 * 6)/4 = - (68.76)/8 + 132/4 = -8.595 + 33 = 24.405 kN\u00b7m? But we had negative.\n\nInconsistency in sign.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's define:\n\nLet bending moment be positive if it causes compression on top (i.e., sagging).\n\nUniform load w downward: causes sagging moment \u2192 positive.\n\nJack force P_j upward at center: causes hogging moment \u2192 negative.\n\nSo M_mid = - (P_j L)/4 + (w L\u00b2)/8\n\nYes, as above.\n\nWith P_j=22, w=1.91, L=6:\n\nM_mid = - (22*6)/4 + (1.91*36)/8 = -33 + 8.595 = -24.405 kN\u00b7m \u2014 matches.\n\nSo general: M_mid = - (P_j L)/4 + (w L\u00b2)/8\n\nSet |M_mid| \u2264 M_yield = 2117.2 kN\u00b7m\n\nBut since M_mid is negative (hogging), we take magnitude.\n\nSo |M_mid| = (P_j L)/4 - (w L\u00b2)/8 \u2264 2117.2\n\nPlug in L=6, w=1.91\n\n(w L\u00b2)/8 = (1.91 * 36)/8 = 8.595 kN\u00b7m\n\nSo:\n\n(P_j * 6)/4 - 8.595 \u2264 2117.2\n\n\u2192 (3/2) P_j \u2264 2117.2 + 8.595 = 2125.795\n\n\u2192 P_j \u2264 (2/3) * 2125.795 \u2248 1417.197 kN\n\nSo P_j,max from beam yielding is approximately **1417 kN**\n\nBut we also have the cables.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Cable constraints**\n\nAt each end, there are five closed loops of steel cables. Each cable has diameter d.\n\nThe reaction at each support is R = (11.46 - P_j)/2 kN\n\nIf P_j > 11.46, R is negative, meaning the support exerts a downward force on the beam \u2014 which implies the cables are in tension, pulling down on the beam.\n\nSo the total tension in the cables at each end is |R| = (P_j - 11.46)/2 kN (since R negative)\n\nThis tension is shared by five cables.\n\nSo tension per cable T = [ (P_j - 11.46)/2 ] / 5 = (P_j - 11.46)/10 kN\n\nCables are made of high-alloy steel. The problem doesn't specify yield stress of cables, but typically for high-alloy steel cables, yield stress can be around 1000-1500 MPa. Since not given, perhaps we assume same as beam? But beam is 400 MPa, cables are likely stronger.\n\nThe problem says \"high-alloy steel cables\", but doesn't give yield stress. This is an issue.\n\nPerhaps we should assume the cables have the same yield stress as the beam? But that would be conservative, and probably not intended.\n\nLooking back: \"neglect the masses and thicknesses... but not yielding\". And \"will not cause yielding in neither beam nor any cables\".\n\nBut no yield stress given for cables. Perhaps we missed it.\n\nRe-read: \"Each beam is made of hot-rolled steel with a yield stress of 400 MPa\" \u2014 only beam specified. Cables: \"high-alloy steel\" \u2014 no yield stress.\n\nThis is problematic. Perhaps in such problems, we assume cables have sufficient strength, or perhaps we need to use a typical value.\n\nMaybe the cables are designed to not yield, and we need to find d_min based on the tension.\n\nBut without yield stress, we can't.\n\nPerhaps the hint \"draw two free-body diagrams\" implies we consider the cable system separately.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the cables are connected to the beam, and the tension is in the cables, but we need the yield stress.\n\nI think there might be an oversight. In many such problems, if not specified, assume same material, or perhaps use 400 MPa.\n\nBut high-alloy steel cables usually have higher strength. For example, prestressing strands have yield around 1500-1800 MPa.\n\nTo proceed, I'll assume that the cables have a yield stress of \u03c3_c = 1500 MPa, as a reasonable value for high-alloy steel cables. If not, please adjust.\n\nSo \u03c3_c = 1500 MPa = 1500 N/mm\u00b2\n\nArea of one cable A_c = \u03c0 d\u00b2 / 4\n\nTension per cable T = (P_j - 11.46)/10 kN = (P_j - 11.46)*100 N (since 1 kN = 1000 N? Wait)\n\nT in kN, so T = (P_j - 11.46)/10 kN = [(P_j - 11.46)/10] * 1000 N = 100*(P_j - 11.46) N\n\nStress in cable \u03c3 = T / A_c = [100*(P_j - 11.46)] / (\u03c0 d\u00b2 / 4) = [400*(P_j - 11.46)] / (\u03c0 d\u00b2) N/mm\u00b2\n\nSet \u03c3 \u2264 \u03c3_c = 1500\n\nSo [400*(P_j - 11.46)] / (\u03c0 d\u00b2) \u2264 1500\n\nThus d\u00b2 \u2265 [400*(P_j - 11.46)] / (1500 \u03c0)\n\nd \u2265 sqrt{ [400*(P_j - 11.46)] / (1500 \u03c0) }\n\nBut P_j is variable. We need to find P_j,max such that both beam and cables are not yielding.\n\nThe beam limits P_j to 1417 kN, but at that force, the cable tension is huge.\n\nT per cable = (1417 - 11.46)/10 = 1405.54 / 10 = 140.554 kN = 140,554 N\n\nThen \u03c3 = T / A_c = 140,554 / (\u03c0 d\u00b2 / 4) = 562,216 / (\u03c0 d\u00b2) N/mm\u00b2\n\nSet \u2264 1500, so 562,216 / (\u03c0 d\u00b2) \u2264 1500\n\nd\u00b2 \u2265 562,216 / (1500 \u03c0) \u2248 562216 / 4712.39 \u2248 119.3\n\nd \u2265 sqrt(119.3) \u2248 10.92 mm\n\nBut this is for P_j=1417 kN, which is limited by beam.\n\nHowever, the cable constraint might be more restrictive if we consider smaller P_j.\n\nActually, for the cables, as P_j increases, tension increases, so to avoid yielding, for a given d, P_j is limited.\n\nBut we need to find P_j,max such that both are satisfied, and then d_min for that P_j.\n\nThe beam allows up to 1417 kN, and at that force, with \u03c3_c=1500 MPa, d_min\u224810.92 mm.\n\nBut is this realistic? Probably, but let's verify if the beam is really the limiting factor.\n\nPerhaps the cables are the limiting factor.\n\nSuppose we set the cable stress to 1500 MPa, then for a given d, T_max = \u03c3_c * A_c = 1500 * \u03c0 d\u00b2 / 4 N\n\nThen total tension at one end = 5 * T_max = 5 * 1500 * \u03c0 d\u00b2 / 4 = (7500 \u03c0 d\u00b2)/4 N\n\nThis equals |R| = (P_j - 11.46)/2 * 1000 N (since R in kN, so multiply by 1000 for N)\n\nR = (11.46 - P_j)/2 kN, so |R| = (P_j - 11.46)/2 kN = (P_j - 11.46)*500 N? No\n\n1 kN = 1000 N, so |R| = [(P_j - 11.46)/2] * 1000 N = 500 (P_j - 11.46) N\n\nSet equal to total cable tension:\n\n500 (P_j - 11.46) = 5 * [1500 * \u03c0 d\u00b2 / 4]\n\nSimplify:\n\n500 (P_j - 11.46) = (7500 \u03c0 d\u00b2)/4\n\nDivide both sides by 500:\n\nP_j - 11.46 = (7500 \u03c0 d\u00b2)/(4*500) = (7500 \u03c0 d\u00b2)/2000 = (15 \u03c0 d\u00b2)/4\n\nSo P_j = 11.46 + (15 \u03c0 d\u00b2)/4\n\nNow, this P_j must also satisfy the beam yielding condition:\n\n|M_mid| = (P_j L)/4 - (w L\u00b2)/8 \u2264 M_yield = 2117.2 kN\u00b7m\n\nWith L=6, w=1.91, (w L\u00b2)/8 = 8.595\n\nSo (6/4) P_j - 8.595 \u2264 2117.2\n\n1.5 P_j \u2264 2125.795\n\nP_j \u2264 1417.197 kN\n\nNow, from cables, P_j = 11.46 + (15 \u03c0 d\u00b2)/4\n\nSet this equal to 1417.197 to find d_min:\n\n11.46 + (15 \u03c0 d\u00b2)/4 = 1417.197\n\n(15 \u03c0 d\u00b2)/4 = 1405.737\n\nd\u00b2 = (1405.737 * 4) / (15 \u03c0) = (5622.948) / (47.1239) \u2248 119.3\n\nd = sqrt(119.3) \u2248 10.92 mm\n\nSo if we use \u03c3_c=1500 MPa, then d_min=10.92 mm, and P_j,max=1417.2 kN\n\nBut is this correct? The beam is not yielding, and cables are at yield.\n\nHowever, typically, we design for safety, but the question asks for \"maximum allowable\" without yielding, so at yield is acceptable for this analysis.\n\nBut let's confirm the beam moment.\n\nAt P_j=1417.2 kN, M_mid = - (1417.2 * 6)/4 + (1.91 * 36)/8 = -2125.8 + 8.595 = -2117.205 kN\u00b7m, which equals M_yield, so yes, beam is at yield.\n\nCables are at yield if d=10.92 mm.\n\nBut d must be such that for the given P_j, stress is not exceeded.\n\nSince P_j is determined by beam, and d is chosen to match, it's consistent.\n\nHowever, if the cable yield stress is different, it changes.\n\nPerhaps the problem intends for us to use the same yield stress, 400 MPa, for cables.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nAssume \u03c3_c = 400 MPa for cables.\n\nThen T_max per cable = 400 * \u03c0 d\u00b2 / 4 = 100 \u03c0 d\u00b2 N\n\nTotal tension at one end = 5 * 100 \u03c0 d\u00b2 = 500 \u03c0 d\u00b2 N\n\nSet equal to |R| = 500 (P_j - 11.46) N\n\nSo 500 (P_j - 11.46) = 500 \u03c0 d\u00b2\n\nThus P_j - 11.46 = \u03c0 d\u00b2\n\nP_j = 11.46 + \u03c0 d\u00b2\n\nNow set this equal to beam limit 1417.2:\n\n11.46 + \u03c0 d\u00b2 = 1417.2\n\n\u03c0 d\u00b2 = 1405.74\n\nd\u00b2 = 1405.74 / \u03c0 \u2248 447.5\n\nd = sqrt(447.5) \u2248 21.16 mm\n\nSo d_min=21.16 mm if cables have \u03c3_y=400 MPa.\n\nBut this is larger, and cables are usually stronger.\n\nGiven that the problem says \"high-alloy steel cables\", it's reasonable to assume higher yield strength.\n\nPerhaps we can leave it in terms of \u03c3_c, but the problem asks for numerical values.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the cables are not yielding under the load, but we need to ensure that the tension does not exceed the yield, and since no \u03c3_c given, maybe we are to use the beam's yield stress.\n\nBut that would be conservative.\n\nPerhaps in the context, the cables are designed to be strong enough, and the beam is the limiting factor, so P_j,max is from beam, and d_min is based on that tension with a reasonable \u03c3_c.\n\nI think for the sake of this problem, I'll use \u03c3_c = 1500 MPa, as it's common for high-strength cables.\n\nSo P_j,max = 1417 kN, d_min = 10.9 mm (rounding).\n\nBut let's be precise.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nP_j,max = 1417.2 kN (from beam)\n\nT per cable = (P_j - 11.46)/10 kN = (1417.2 - 11.46)/10 = 1405.74/10 = 140.574 kN = 140,574 N\n\n\u03c3_c = 1500 N/mm\u00b2\n\nA_c = T / \u03c3_c = 140,574 / 1500 = 93.716 mm\u00b2\n\nA_c = \u03c0 d\u00b2 / 4 = 93.716\n\nd\u00b2 = 93.716 * 4 / \u03c0 = 374.864 / 3.1416 \u2248 119.32\n\nd = sqrt(119.32) = 10.92 mm\n\nSo d_min = 10.92 mm\n\nWe can report as 11.0 mm or keep as 10.9 mm.\n\nBut let's see if there's another constraint.\n\nAlso, the jack force is compressive on the jack, but the jack is stiff, and we are not concerned with it.\n\nAlso, the beam is in bending, not axial, so no axial yield.\n\nSo I think this is it.\n\n**Answer 4b:**\n> The maximum allowable jack force \\( P_{j,\\max} = 1417 \\text{ kN} \\) (limited by beam yielding).\n> The minimum allowable cable diameter \\( d_{\\min} = 10.9 \\text{ mm} \\) (assuming high-alloy steel cables with yield stress of 1500 MPa).\n\n---\n\n**Question 4c: Calculate the maximum flexural stress (in MPa) each beam experiences based upon the maximum allowable jack force you obtained in part (b).**\n\n---\n\nFrom part (b), at P_j,max = 1417.2 kN, the bending moment at midspan is M = -2117.2 kN\u00b7m (magnitude 2117.2 kN\u00b7m)\n\nThe section modulus Z = I / y_max = 1.646e9 mm\u2074 / 311 mm = 5,292,604 mm\u00b3 = 5.2926e6 mm\u00b3\n\nFlexural stress \u03c3 = M / Z\n\nM = 2117.2 kN\u00b7m = 2117.2 * 1000 * 1000 N\u00b7mm = 2.1172e9 N\u00b7mm\n\nZ = 5.2926e6 mm\u00b3\n\n\u03c3 = 2.1172e9 / 5.2926e6 = 400.0 MPa\n\nExactly the yield stress, as expected, since we set M = M_yield.\n\nSo maximum flexural stress is 400 MPa.\n\n**Answer 4c:**\n> The maximum flexural stress in each beam is **400 MPa**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answers:**\n\n**4a:** Bending moment diagram is a symmetric parabola with zero at supports D and E, and a minimum (most negative) value of **-24.4 kN\u00b7m** at midspan (point B).
