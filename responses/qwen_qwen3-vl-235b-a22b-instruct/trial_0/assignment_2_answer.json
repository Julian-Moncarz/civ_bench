  "answer": "**Question 3a: What is the impact velocity of the dropped mass just before it hits the catch plate, expressed as an algebraic expression?**\n\nWe use conservation of energy. The potential energy at height \\( h \\) converts entirely to kinetic energy just before impact (neglecting air resistance and self-weight).\n\n\\[\nmgh = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\n\\]\n\nCancel mass \\( m \\):\n\n\\[\ngh = \\frac{1}{2}v^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v^2 = 2gh \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v = \\sqrt{2gh}\n\\]\n\n\u2705 **Answer 3a:**  \n\\[\n\\boxed{v = \\sqrt{2gh}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Question 3b: What is the maximum value of \\( h \\) which does not cause any permanent deformations in the wire?**\n\nPermanent deformation begins when the wire reaches its **yield strain**. Since strain-hardening is neglected and we are to avoid permanent deformation, we assume the wire remains within the elastic range. The problem gives a **rupture strain** of 0.25 mm/mm \u2014 but this is the ultimate strain at failure. For no permanent deformation, we must limit strain to the **elastic limit**, which for low alloy steel is typically less than rupture strain.\n\nHowever, the problem does not give yield strain or modulus of elasticity explicitly. But note: since we are told to avoid *permanent* deformations, and rupture strain is given (but not yield strain), we might infer that the question intends for us to use the **rupture strain as the upper limit for elastic behavior** \u2014 which is physically incorrect, but perhaps intended for simplicity in this context.\n\nAlternatively, we may need to assume that \u201cno permanent deformation\u201d means strain \u2264 rupture strain \u2014 but that\u2019s not standard. However, since no other material property is given, and rupture strain is provided, perhaps the intent is to use rupture strain as the maximum allowable strain to prevent rupture (which would include avoiding permanent deformation). But that conflates yielding and rupture.\n\nWait \u2014 re-reading: \u201cdoes not cause any permanent deformations\u201d \u2192 implies we must stay within elastic limit. But since no yield stress or yield strain is given, and rupture strain is given, perhaps we\u2019re expected to assume the elastic limit coincides with rupture strain? That is unphysical, but possible in simplified problems.\n\nActually, in many textbook problems like this, if only rupture strain is given and no yield info, they sometimes intend you to use rupture strain as the maximum allowable strain for \"no failure\" \u2014 including no permanent set. So we proceed with:\n\n**Maximum allowable strain = rupture strain = 0.25 mm/mm = 0.25**\n\nThis is a dimensionless quantity (strain = \u0394L / L\u2080).\n\nThe wire length \\( L_0 = 2500 \\) mm.\n\nSo maximum allowable extension:  \n\\[\n\\Delta L_{\\text{max}} = \\epsilon_{\\text{rupture}} \\cdot L_0 = 0.25 \\times 2500 = 625 \\text{ mm} = 0.625 \\text{ m}\n\\]\n\nNow, during impact, the falling mass converts its kinetic energy into elastic potential energy stored in the wire.\n\nAt maximum extension, all kinetic energy is converted to strain energy (assuming no damping, perfectly elastic wire):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{1}{2}k (\\Delta L)^2\n\\]\n\nBut also, from Hooke\u2019s Law: \\( F = k \\Delta L \\), and \\( \\sigma = E \\epsilon \\), so we can express spring constant \\( k \\) as:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{EA}{L_0}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( E \\) = Young\u2019s modulus of low alloy steel \u2014 **not given!**\n\nUh oh \u2014 problem does not provide Young\u2019s modulus. This is critical.\n\nLooking back: we have diameter (6 mm), length (2500 mm), mass (4 kg), rupture strain (0.25), but no E.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps we need to express everything symbolically? Or maybe the problem expects us to know or assume E for low alloy steel?\n\nTypical value for low alloy steel: \\( E \\approx 200 \\, \\text{GPa} = 200 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{Pa} \\)\n\nLet\u2019s proceed with that assumption.\n\nCross-sectional area:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4} = \\frac{\\pi (6 \\times 10^{-3})^2}{4} = \\frac{\\pi \\cdot 36 \\times 10^{-6}}{4} = 9\\pi \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}^2 \\approx 2.8274 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{m}^2\n\\]\n\nLength \\( L_0 = 2.5 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n\nSpring constant:\n\\[\nk = \\frac{EA}{L_0} = \\frac{(200 \\times 10^9)(2.8274 \\times 10^{-5})}{2.5} = \\frac{5.6548 \\times 10^6}{2.5} = 2.2619 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{N/m}\n\\]\n\nNow, energy balance:\n\nKinetic energy at impact = Strain energy at max extension\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{1}{2}k (\\Delta L)^2\n\\]\n\nCancel 1/2:\n\n\\[\nmv^2 = k (\\Delta L)^2\n\\]\n\nBut \\( v = \\sqrt{2gh} \\), so:\n\n\\[\nm(2gh) = k (\\Delta L)^2\n\\]\n\nSolve for h:\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{k (\\Delta L)^2}{2mg}\n\\]\n\nPlug in values:\n\n- \\( k = 2.2619 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{N/m} \\)\n- \\( \\Delta L = 0.625 \\, \\text{m} \\)\n- \\( m = 4 \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n- \\( g = 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\)\n\nCompute:\n\n\\[\n(\\Delta L)^2 = (0.625)^2 = 0.390625\n\\]\n\n\\[\nk (\\Delta L)^2 = 2.2619 \\times 10^6 \\times 0.390625 \\approx 883,554.6875\n\\]\n\n\\[\n2mg = 2 \\times 4 \\times 9.81 = 78.48\n\\]\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{883554.6875}{78.48} \\approx 11258.7 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nThat\u2019s over 11 km \u2014 clearly unreasonable. Why? Because we used rupture strain as allowable strain for elastic deformation \u2014 which is wrong. Rupture strain is beyond yield; using it here implies we allow plastic deformation, which contradicts \u201cno permanent deformations\u201d.\n\nSo we must be missing something.\n\nAlternative interpretation: Perhaps \u201cno permanent deformations\u201d means we stay within elastic limit, and rupture strain is given only for part (e). For part (b), we should find the maximum h such that the stress doesn\u2019t exceed yield stress.\n\nBut again, no yield stress or yield strain is given.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the problem expects us to use the rupture strain as the maximum strain for \u201cno rupture\u201d, and interpret \u201cno permanent deformation\u201d as synonymous with \u201cno rupture\u201d \u2014 which is technically incorrect, but maybe intended.\n\nBut even then, 11 km is absurd.\n\nPerhaps we made a mistake in units.\n\nCheck:\n\n\u0394L = 625 mm = 0.625 m \u2014 correct.\n\nA = \u03c0*(0.006)^2 / 4 = \u03c0*3.6e-5 / 4 = \u03c0*9e-6 = 2.827e-5 m\u00b2 \u2014 correct.\n\nE = 200e9 Pa \u2014 correct.\n\nk = EA/L = 200e9 * 2.827e-5 / 2.5 = (5.654e6) / 2.5 = 2.2616e6 N/m \u2014 correct.\n\nThen:\n\nh = [k (\u0394L)^2] / (2mg) = [2.2616e6 * (0.625)^2] / (2*4*9.81) = [2.2616e6 * 0.390625] / 78.48 = 883,500 / 78.48 \u2248 11,258 m \u2014 still absurd.\n\nThe issue is that rupture strain of 0.25 is enormous for steel. Typical rupture strain for steel is around 0.15\u20130.30, but for low alloy steel under tension, it\u2019s often around 0.20\u20130.25, yes. But the resulting extension is 625 mm on a 2.5 m wire \u2014 that's a lot, but possible for ductile materials.\n\nBut the energy required to stretch it that much is huge, hence the high h.\n\nBut physically, if you drop a 4 kg mass from 11 km, it will be going very fast, and the wire will experience huge forces \u2014 but in reality, air resistance would dominate, and the wire would likely snap long before due to dynamic effects.\n\nPerhaps the problem intends for us to use the rupture strain as the maximum strain, and proceed.\n\nBut let's double-check the rupture strain: \u201c0.25 mm/mm\u201d \u2014 that's 0.25, which is 25% strain \u2014 typical for ductile steel, yes.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps \u201cno permanent deformation\u201d means we stay within proportional limit, and rupture strain is given for later parts. But without yield stress, we can't proceed.\n\nUnless \u2014 perhaps the problem expects us to realize that for no permanent deformation, the maximum strain is the yield strain, and since it's not given, we can't calculate numerically, and must leave symbolic.\n\nBut the question asks for \u201cmaximum value of h\u201d, implying a number.\n\nPerhaps we misread the rupture strain. \u201c0.25 mm/mm\u201d \u2014 is that 0.25 or 0.00025? No, 0.25 mm/mm is 0.25, since mm/mm is dimensionless.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the rupture strain is 0.25, but for elastic deformation, we should use a smaller value. But not given.\n\nLet's look at part (c): if h=2.2 m, what is max force. We can calculate that, and see if it makes sense.\n\nPerhaps for part (b), \"no permanent deformation\" means that the stress does not exceed the yield stress, and since it's not given, maybe we are to assume that the wire is linear elastic up to rupture strain \u2014 i.e., idealized elastic-perfectly plastic with yield at rupture \u2014 which is common in some simplified models.\n\nIn that case, we proceed with rupture strain as the maximum allowable strain for elastic behavior.\n\nSo h \u2248 11,258 m \u2014 but that seems too large.\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the energy equation.\n\nWhen the mass falls and stretches the wire, the energy balance is:\n\nLoss in potential energy = gain in elastic potential energy + gain in gravitational potential energy during stretching.\n\nI forgot that! When the wire stretches by \u0394L, the mass descends an additional \u0394L, so the total distance fallen is h + \u0394L.\n\nSo correct energy balance:\n\nInitial PE: mg(h + \u0394L)  (because at max extension, the mass has descended h + \u0394L from initial position)\n\nFinal KE = 0\n\nFinal elastic PE = (1/2)k (\u0394L)^2\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nmg(h + \\Delta L) = \\frac{1}{2}k (\\Delta L)^2\n\\]\n\nThis is crucial!\n\nPreviously I used only mg h = (1/2)k (\u0394L)^2, but that's incorrect because the mass continues to fall during the stretching process.\n\nCorrect equation:\n\n\\[\nmg(h + \\Delta L) = \\frac{1}{2}k (\\Delta L)^2\n\\]\n\nSolve for h:\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{k}{mg} (\\Delta L)^2 - \\Delta L\n\\]\n\nNow plug in numbers.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nk = 2.2619e6 N/m\n\nm = 4 kg\n\ng = 9.81 m/s\u00b2\n\n\u0394L = 0.625 m\n\nFirst, compute k/(mg) = 2.2619e6 / (4*9.81) = 2.2619e6 / 39.24 \u2248 57,642.7\n\nThen (1/2)*57,642.7 * (0.625)^2 = 0.5 * 57,642.7 * 0.390625 \u2248 0.5 * 22,517.5 = 11,258.75\n\nThen h = 11,258.75 - 0.625 = 11,258.125 m\n\nStill approximately 11,258 m.\n\nThis is still absurd, but mathematically correct given the assumptions.\n\nPerhaps the rupture strain is 0.25, but for low alloy steel, the actual yield strain is much smaller. For example, if yield stress is 300 MPa, E=200 GPa, then yield strain = 300e6 / 200e9 = 0.0015.\n\nIf we use yield strain = 0.0015, then \u0394L = 0.0015 * 2.5 = 0.00375 m\n\nThen h = [k (\u0394L)^2 / (2mg)] - \u0394L  (from the corrected equation)\n\nk = 2.2619e6 N/m\n\n\u0394L = 0.00375 m\n\n(\u0394L)^2 = 1.40625e-5\n\nk (\u0394L)^2 = 2.2619e6 * 1.40625e-5 = 31.81\n\n2mg = 78.48\n\nSo (1/2) * k (\u0394L)^2 / (mg) wait no.\n\nFrom:\n\nh = [k (\u0394L)^2 / (2mg)] - \u0394L\n\n= [2.2619e6 * (1.40625e-5) / (2*4*9.81)] - 0.00375\n\nFirst, 2.2619e6 * 1.40625e-5 = 31.81\n\n2*4*9.81 = 78.48\n\nSo 31.81 / 78.48 = 0.4053\n\nThen h = 0.4053 - 0.00375 = 0.40155 m\n\nApproximately 0.4 m.\n\nThis is more reasonable.\n\nBut the problem does not give yield stress or yield strain. It gives rupture strain.\n\nPerhaps for \"no permanent deformation\", we should use the yield strain, but it's not given.\n\nMaybe in this context, \"rupture strain\" is a red herring for part (b), and we are to assume that the wire is elastic up to rupture, but that leads to large h.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps \"0.25 mm/mm\" is a typo, and it's 0.25 \u00d7 10^{-3} mm/mm or something, but it's written as 0.25 mm/mm.\n\nLet's check the units: \"0.25 mm/mm\" \u2014 that's 0.25, as mm/mm cancels.\n\nPerhaps it's 0.25%, i.e., 0.0025, but it's written as 0.25 mm/mm.\n\nI think there's a mistake in the problem or in my understanding.\n\nLet's look at part (c): if h=2.2 m, what is max force.\n\nFor that, we can use the energy method with the correct energy balance.\n\nSo for part (b), perhaps the intended answer is based on yield strain, but since not given, maybe we are to use rupture strain, and accept the large number.\n\nPerhaps \"no permanent deformation\" means that the stress does not exceed the proportional limit, and for steel, it's approximately the same as yield stress, and we can use a standard value.\n\nBut to proceed, I'll assume that for part (b), we are to use the rupture strain as the maximum allowable strain, and use the correct energy balance.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n h = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{k}{mg} (\\Delta L)^2 - \\Delta L\n\\]\n\nWith \u0394L = \u03b5_rupture * L0 = 0.25 * 2.5 = 0.625 m\n\nk = EA/L0\n\nE = 200e9 Pa (assumed)\n\nA = \u03c0*(0.006)^2/4 = \u03c0*9e-6 = 2.8274e-5 m\u00b2\n\nL0 = 2.5 m\n\nk = 200e9 * 2.8274e-5 / 2.5 = 2.2619e6 N/m\n\nm = 4 kg\n\ng = 9.81 m/s\u00b2\n\nSo:\n\nk/(mg) = 2.2619e6 / (4*9.81) = 2.2619e6 / 39.24 = 57,642.7\n\nThen (1/2) * 57,642.7 * (0.625)^2 = 0.5 * 57,642.7 * 0.390625 = 0.5 * 22,517.5 = 11,258.75\n\nThen h = 11,258.75 - 0.625 = 11,258.125 m\n\nSo approximately 11,258 m.\n\nBut this is unrealistic, so perhaps the rupture strain is 0.25\u00d710^{-3} = 0.00025.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nIf rupture strain = 0.00025, then \u0394L = 0.00025 * 2.5 = 0.000625 m\n\nThen k (\u0394L)^2 = 2.2619e6 * (0.000625)^2 = 2.2619e6 * 3.90625e-7 = 0.8835\n\n2mg = 78.48\n\nSo (1/2) * k (\u0394L)^2 / (mg) = 0.8835 / (2*4*9.81) wait no.\n\nFrom h = [k (\u0394L)^2 / (2mg)] -

0.00625 = 1.11955 m\n\nThis is reasonable, and for h=2.2 m, it would be larger, which matches part (c).\n\nMoreover, for low alloy steel, yield strain is around 0.0015 to 0.002, so 0.0025 is a bit high but plausible for rupture strain.\n\nPerhaps the \"0.25 mm/mm\" is meant to be 0.25%, i.e., 0.0025.\n\nIn many contexts, strain is reported as percentage, so 0.25% = 0.0025.\n\nI think this is likely the intended interpretation.\n\nSo I'll assume that \"0.25 mm/mm\" is a misnomer, and it should be 0.25% , i.e., 0.0025.\n\nSo for part (b), maximum h for no permanent deformation (i.e., strain \u2264 yield strain, and we use rupture strain as proxy or for simplicity, but 0.0025 is more reasonable).\n\nSo let's proceed with \u03b5_max = 0.0025 for part (b).\n\nSo \u0394L_max = 0.0025 * 2.5 = 0.00625 m\n\nk = 2.2619e6 N/m\n\nm = 4 kg\n\ng = 9.81 m/s\u00b2\n\nFrom energy balance:\n\n\\[\n mg(h + \\Delta L) = \\frac{1}{2} k (\\Delta L)^2\n\\]\n\nSo\n\n\\[\n h = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{k}{mg} (\\Delta L)^2 -

How many drops can the wire sustain before rupturing?**\n\nThis is a fatigue problem. The wire will rupture after a certain number of cycles when the stress amplitude exceeds the fatigue limit.\n\nBut the problem does not provide any fatigue data, such as S-N curve or endurance limit.\n\nPerhaps we are to assume that each drop causes a stress that is below the rupture stress, but cumulative damage occurs.\n\nSince no data is given, perhaps we are to use the rupture strain as the limiting strain, and each drop causes a strain of \u03b4/L0 = 0.0087518 / 2.5 = 0.00350072\n\nRupture strain = 0.0025 (as assumed)\n\nBut 0.0035 > 0.0025, so on the first drop, the strain exceeds the rupture strain, so it should rupture immediately.\n\nFrom part (c), with h=2.2 m, \u03b4 = 0.00875 m, strain = \u03b4/L0 = 0.00875 / 2.5 = 0.0035\n\nIf rupture strain is 0.0025, then 0.0035 > 0.0025, so it should rupture on the first drop.\n\nBut the problem says \"eventually rupture\", implying multiple drops.\n\nPerhaps rupture strain is 0.25, not 0.0025.\n\nLet's try with rupture strain = 0.25.\n\nThen for h=2.2 m, \u03b4 = 0.00875 m, strain = 0.00875 / 2.5 = 0.0035, which is much less than 0.25, so it doesn't rupture on first drop.\n\nThen for fatigue, we need the stress amplitude.\n\nMax stress \u03c3_max = F_max / A = 19,795 / (\u03c0*(0.006)^2/4) = 19,795 / (2.8274e-5) = 7.00e8 Pa = 700 MPa\n\nMin stress \u03c3_min = 0 (since it's a drop, and we assume the wire returns to zero stress after each drop, but actually, after impact, it may oscillate, but typically for such problems, we consider the stress range from 0 to \u03c3_max.\n\nFor fatigue, the stress amplitude \u03c3_a = (\u03c3_max - \u03c3_min)/2 = \u03c3_max / 2 = 350 MPa\n\nThe mean stress \u03c3_m = \u03c3_max / 2 = 350 MPa\n\nFor low alloy steel, the endurance limit is approximately 0.5 times tensile strength, but not given.\n\nTypical tensile strength for low alloy steel is 500-1000 MPa, say 600 MPa, so endurance limit ~300 MPa.\n\nHere \u03c3_a = 350 MPa > 300 MPa, so it will fail in finite cycles.\n\nBut without S-N curve, we can't calculate the number of cycles.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects us to use the strain range.\n\nStrain amplitude \u03b5_a = (\u03b5_max - \u03b5_min)/2 = \u03b5_max / 2 = 0.0035 / 2 = 0.00175\n\nRupture strain = 0.25, but for fatigue, it's different.\n\nThis is not sufficient.\n\nPerhaps \"rupture strain\" is given for static load, and for repeated drops, we use the static rupture strain as the limit, but since each drop causes strain 0.0035 < ",
