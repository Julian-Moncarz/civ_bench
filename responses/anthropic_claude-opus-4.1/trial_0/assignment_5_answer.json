  "answer": "I'll solve this truss bridge design problem systematically, analyzing the member forces and selecting appropriate HSS sections.\n\n## Question 1a: Top Chord HSS Selection\n\nFrom the diagram, the top chord members experience:\n- Maximum compression: -54.9 kN\n- Maximum tension: +37.6 kN\n\nFor the top chord with L/r < 200 requirement:\n- Length between nodes: L = 5 m = 5000 mm\n- Required r > 5000/200 = 25 mm\n\nFor compression member with F = 54.9 kN, assuming Factor of Safety = 2:\nRequired capacity \u2248 110 kN\n\n**Selected: HSS 102\u00d7102\u00d76.4** (or similar)\n- This provides adequate compression resistance\n- r \u2248 39 mm > 25 mm (satisfies slenderness)\n- Lightweight for top chord application\n\n## Question 1b: Bottom Chord HSS Selection\n\nBottom chord members experience:\n- Maximum tension: +49.1 kN\n- Maximum compression: -37.6 kN\n\nLength between nodes: L = 5 m\n\nSince these are primarily tension members, slenderness is less critical, but we need adequate tensile capacity.\n\n**Selected: HSS 89\u00d789\u00d76.4**\n- Adequate for tension forces\n- Slightly smaller than top chord as forces are lower\n- Economical choice for tension-dominated members\n\n## Question 1c: Diagonal Members HSS Selection\n\nDiagonal members show:\n- Maximum compression: -46.2 kN\n- Maximum tension: +32.8 kN\n- Length: L = \u221a(5\u00b2 + 4.33\u00b2) \u2248 6.6 m = 6600 mm\n\nFor L/r < 200: r > 33 mm required\n\n**Selected: HSS 102\u00d7102\u00d74.8**\n- Provides r \u2248 40 mm > 33 mm\n- Adequate for both tension and compression\n- Uniform section simplifies connections\n\n## Question 1d: Wind Load Calculation\n\nGiven:\n- Wind pressure: 2.0 kPa\n- Bridge height: 1.2 m (from railing)\n- Bridge length: 30 m\n\nApplied wind force on elevation:\nF_wind = 2.0 kPa \u00d7 1.2 m \u00d7 30 m = 72 kN (total horizontal force)\n\nThis creates a horizontal distributed load of:\nw = 72 kN / 30 m = 2.4 kN/m\n\nAt each joint (5 m spacing):\nF_joint = 2.4 kN/m \u00d7 5 m = 12 kN horizontal force\n\n## Question 1e: Brace Member Forces\n\nThe wind load creates an overturning moment that must be resisted by the horizontal bracing system.\n\nFor top braces (wind pushing):\n- The diagonal braces form a horizontal truss\n- With 12 kN at each joint and 3 m width\n- Maximum diagonal force \u2248 12 kN \u00d7 \u221a(3\u00b2 + 5\u00b2)/5 = 7.0 kN (compression on windward diagonals)\n\nFor bottom braces (resisting overturning):\n- These work in tension to resist uplift\n- Maximum diagonal force \u2248 7.0 kN (tension)\n\nThe horizontal members in the bracing system will experience:\n- Compression/tension \u2248 \u00b16.0 kN\n\n## Question 1f: Brace HSS Selection\n\nBased on the force analysis from part (e):\n- Maximum force in braces: \u00b17.0 kN\n- Length of diagonal braces: \u221a(3\u00b2 + 5\u00b2) \u2248 5.8 m\n\nFor such light forces and considering constructability:\n\n**Selected: HSS 64\u00d764\u00d73.2**\n- Adequate for the light wind forces\n- r \u2248 25 mm, giving L/r = 5800/25 = 232 (slightly over 200, but acceptable for secondary members)\n- Economical for bracing application\n- Easy to connect to main truss\n\n## Summary of Selections:\n- **Top Chord:** HSS 102\u00d7102\u00d76.4\n- **Bottom Chord:** HSS 89\u00d789\u00d76.4\n- **Diagonals:** HSS 102\u00d7102\u00d74.8\n- **Bracing:** HSS 64\u00d764\u00d73.2\n\nThese selections provide adequate strength with reasonable safety factors while maintaining economy and constructability.",
