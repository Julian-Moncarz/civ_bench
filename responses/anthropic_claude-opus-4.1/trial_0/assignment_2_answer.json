  "answer": "I'll solve this impact loading problem on a steel wire step by step.\n\n## Given Information:\n- Wire length: L = 2,500 mm = 2.5 m\n- Wire diameter: d = 6 mm\n- Dropped mass: m = 4 kg\n- Drop height: h (variable)\n- Rupture strain: \u03b5\u1d63 = 0.25 mm/mm = 0.25\n- Neglect: strain-hardening, self-weights, air resistance, thicknesses\n\n## Question 3a: Impact velocity of the dropped mass\n\nUsing conservation of energy for free fall:\n- Potential energy at height h = Kinetic energy just before impact\n- mgh = \u00bdmv\u00b2\n\nSolving for velocity:\nv = \u221a(2gh)\n\n**Answer 3a:** v = \u221a(2gh)\n\n## Question 3b: Maximum height h without permanent deformation\n\nFor elastic behavior (no permanent deformation), I need to determine the yield condition. Since we're dealing with low alloy steel and told to neglect strain-hardening, I'll use typical values for structural steel:\n- Modulus of Elasticity: E \u2248 200 GPa = 200,000 MPa\n- Yield stress: \u03c3y \u2248 250 MPa (typical for low alloy steel)\n\nCross-sectional area: A = \u03c0d\u00b2/4 = \u03c0(6)\u00b2/4 = 28.27 mm\u00b2\n\nFor dynamic loading, using energy method:\n- Impact energy = Strain energy absorbed elastically\n- mg(h + \u03b4) = \u00bd(P\u00b2L)/(EA)\n\nWhere \u03b4 is the elastic extension and P is the maximum force.\n\nAt yield: P = \u03c3y \u00d7 A = 250 \u00d7 28.27 = 7,068 N\n\nMaximum elastic extension: \u03b4 = PL/(EA) = (7,068 \u00d7 2,500)/(200,000 \u00d7 28.27) = 3.125 mm\n\nUsing energy balance:\nmg(h + \u03b4) = \u00bdP\u03b4\n4 \u00d7 9.81(h + 0.003125) = \u00bd \u00d7 7,068 \u00d7 0.003125\n39.24h + 0.1226 = 11.04\nh = (11.04 - 0.1226)/39.24 = 0.278 m\n\n**Answer 3b:** h = 278 mm or 0.278 m\n\n## Question 3c: Maximum force at h = 2.2 m\n\nWith h = 2.2 m > 0.278 m, the wire will yield and experience plastic deformation.\n\nUsing energy method for plastic deformation:\nImpact velocity: v = \u221a(2 \u00d7 9.81 \u00d7 2.2) = 6.57 m/s\n\nThe maximum force occurs when the wire reaches maximum extension. Using impulse-momentum:\nThe impact creates a sudden tension that must decelerate the mass.\n\nFor simplified analysis with plastic deformation:\nDynamic factor: Kd = 1 + \u221a(1 + 2h/\u03b4st)\n\nStatic deflection: \u03b4st = mg L/(EA) = (4 \u00d7 9.81 \u00d7 2,500)/(200,000 \u00d7 28.27) = 0.0174 mm\n\nDynamic factor: Kd = 1 + \u221a(1 + 2 \u00d7 2,200/0.0174) = 1 + \u221a(252,874) = 504\n\nMaximum force: Fmax = Kd \u00d7 mg = 504 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 9.81 = 19,783 N\n\n**Answer 3c:** Fmax \u2248 19,800 N or 19.8 kN\n\n## Question 3d: Maximum extension at h = 2.2 m\n\nUsing conservation of energy:\nmg(h + \u03b4max) = Work done in extending wire\n\nFor plastic deformation beyond yield:\nTotal energy = Elastic energy + Plastic energy\nmg(h + \u03b4max) = \u00bd\u03c3yA\u03b4y + \u03c3yA(\u03b4max - \u03b4y)\n\nWhere \u03b4y = \u03c3yL/(E) = (250 \u00d7 2,500)/200,000 = 3.125 mm\n\nSolving for \u03b4max:\n4 \u00d7 9.81 \u00d7 (2,200 + \u03b4max) = \u00bd \u00d7 250 \u00d7 28.27 \u00d7 3.125 + 250 \u00d7 28.27 \u00d7 (\u03b4max - 3.125)\n86,328 + 39.24\u03b4max = 11,044 + 7,068\u03b4max - 22,088\n86,328 + 39.24\u03b4max = 7,068\u03b4max - 11,044\n97,372 = 7,029\u03b4max\n\u03b4max = 13.86 mm\n\n**Answer 3d:** Maximum extension = 13.9 mm\n\n## Question 3e: Number of drops before rupture\n\nRupture occurs when total strain reaches \u03b5\u1d63 = 0.25\nMaximum allowable extension: \u03b4\u1d63 = \u03b5\u1d63 \u00d7 L = 0.25 \u00d7 2,500 = 625 mm\n\nEach drop from h = 2.2 m causes plastic extension of:\nPlastic extension per drop = \u03b4max - elastic recovery = 13.86 - 3.125 = 10.74 mm\n\nNumber of drops = 625/10.74 = 58.2\n\n**Answer 3e:** The wire can sustain 58 drops before rupturing.",
