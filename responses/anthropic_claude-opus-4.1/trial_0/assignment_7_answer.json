  "answer": "I'll solve this beam-straightening problem step by step.\n\n## Given Information:\n- Beam span: 5.5 m (0.5 + 2.5 + 2.5 + 0.5)\n- Cross-section: I-beam with dimensions shown in Figure 2\n- Yield stress: 400 MPa\n- Mass per beam: 1,168 kg\n- Jack force for straightening: Pj = 22 kN\n\n## Question 4a: Bending Moment Diagram for Top Beam\n\nWhen beam DAE is straight and has elastically recovered, the system is in equilibrium with the jack force of 22 kN pushing up on the bottom beam at point B.\n\nFor the top beam analysis:\n- The jack force creates an upward reaction at point C\n- The top beam is supported at points D and E\n- Point C experiences a downward force from the jack reaction\n\nUsing statics for the top beam:\n- Span: 5.5 m total\n- Jack force location: at midspan (2.75 m from each end)\n- Downward force at C: 22 kN\n\n**Reaction forces:**\nBy symmetry: RD = RE = 22/2 = 11 kN (upward)\n\n**Bending Moment Diagram:**\n- At D: M = 0\n- At C: M = 11 \u00d7 2.75 = 30.25 kN\u00b7m (positive - causing tension in bottom fiber)\n- At E: M = 0\n\nThe moment diagram is triangular with maximum at point C.\n\n**Answer 4a:** Maximum moment = 30.25 kN\u00b7m at point C\n\n## Question 4b: Maximum Allowable Jack Force\n\nTo prevent yielding when the beam curves up again (concave up), we need to ensure the maximum stress doesn't exceed 400 MPa.\n\nFirst, calculate the moment of inertia:\n- Top flange: 327 \u00d7 24 mm\n- Web: 15.4 \u00d7 622 mm  \n- Bottom flange: 327 \u00d7 24 mm\n- Total height: 670 mm\n\nCentroid location (from bottom):\ny\u0305 = 335 mm (by symmetry)\n\nMoment of inertia:\nI = 2 \u00d7 (1/12 \u00d7 327 \u00d7 24\u00b3 + 327 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 311\u00b2) + 1/12 \u00d7 15.4 \u00d7 622\u00b3\nI = 2 \u00d7 (373,248 + 758,146,704) + 312,458,759\nI = 1,829,121,663 mm\u2074\n\nSection modulus:\nS = I/c = 1,829,121,663/335 = 5,460,364 mm\u00b3\n\nMaximum allowable moment:\nMmax = \u03c3y \u00d7 S = 400 \u00d7 5,460,364 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2076 = 2,184.1 kN\u00b7m\n\nSince M = Pj \u00d7 L/4 for the loading configuration:\nPj,max = 4M/L = 4 \u00d7 2,184.1/5.5 = 1,588.4 kN\n\nHowever, this seems unreasonably high. Let me recalculate considering the actual loading pattern.\n\nFor the jack at midspan creating maximum moment of Pj \u00d7 2.75/2:\nMmax = Pj,max \u00d7 1.375\n2,184.1 = Pj,max \u00d7 1.375\nPj,max = 1,588.4 kN\n\nThis is still very high. The cables must have a diameter to support this force.\n\n**Minimum cable diameter:**\nUsing steel cables with typical tensile strength of 1570 MPa:\nRequired area = Pj,max/\u03c3tensile = 1,588,400/1570 = 1,012 mm\u00b2\ndmin = \u221a(4A/\u03c0) = \u221a(4 \u00d7 1,012/\u03c0) = 35.9 mm\n\n**Answer 4b:** Pj,max = 1,588.4 kN, dmin = 36 mm\n\n## Question 4c: Maximum Flexural Stress\n\nUsing the maximum allowable jack force from part (b):\n\nMaximum moment = Pj,max \u00d7 2.75/2 = 1,588.4 \u00d7 1.375 = 2,184.1 kN\u00b7m\n\nMaximum flexural stress:\n\u03c3max = M \u00d7 c/I = 2,184.1 \u00d7 10\u2076 \u00d7 335/1,829,121,663\n\u03c3max = 400 MPa\n\n**Answer 4c:** Maximum flexural stress = 400 MPa\n\nThis confirms our calculation - the maximum allowable jack force produces exactly the yield stress in the beam, which is the limiting condition.",
