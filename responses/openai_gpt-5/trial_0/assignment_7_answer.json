  "answer": "Question 4a: BMD for the top beam when the jack force is 22 kN\n\nGiven/assumptions\n- Simply supported beam, span L = 2.5 m + 2.5 m = 5.0 m (from the figure).\n- Uniformly distributed load due to self\u2011weight of one beam:\n  m = 1,168 kg \u2192 W = mg = 1,168(9.81) = 11.458 kN.\n  w = W/L = 11.458/5 = 2.2916 kN/m (downward).\n- Jack force on the top beam at midspan: Pj = 22 kN (downward).\n\nSupport reactions (symmetry):\nR_A = R_B = (wL + Pj)/2 = (11.458 + 22)/2 = 16.729 kN.\n\nBending moment diagram (sagging, positive)\n- M(x) for 0 \u2264 x \u2264 L/2: M(x) = R_A x \u2212 w x^2/2.\n- Maximum moment at midspan (continuous at the point load):\nM_max = wL^2/8 + Pj L/4\n      = (2.2916)(5^2)/8 + 22(5)/4\n      = 7.161 + 27.5\n      = 34.66 kN\u00b7m (sagging, at midspan).\n- Moments at the supports: M_A = M_B = 0.\n\nSketch description: zero at A, parabolic rise due to w to mid\u2011span, plus linear contribution from the midspan point load; symmetric about the center; maximum labeled 34.66 kN\u00b7m at midspan; reactions 16.73 kN at both supports.\n\nQuestion 4b: Pj,max and dmin to avoid yielding of either beam or cables\n\nSection properties of the simplified steel I\u2011section (from Fig. 2; mm units)\n- b_f = 327, t_f = 24, t_w = 15.4, overall depth h = 622 \u2192 web height = 574.\n- Neutral axis at mid\u2011depth; c = h/2 = 311 mm.\n\nFlanges (two):\nA_f = b_f t_f = 327(24) = 7,848 mm^2.\ny_f = 311 \u2212 12 = 299 mm.\nI_f,each about NA = (b_f t_f^3)/12 + A_f y_f^2\n                   = 376,704 + 7,848(299^2)\n                   = 376,704 + 701,619,048\n                   = 701,995,752 mm^4.\nTwo flanges: 1,403,991,504 mm^4.\n\nWeb:\nI_web = t_w h_web^3/12 = 15.4(574^3)/12 = 242,703,004 mm^4.\n\nTotal moment of inertia:\nI = 1,646,694,508 mm^4 = 1.6467\u00d710^9 mm^4.\nSection modulus:\nZ = I/c = 1.6467\u00d710^9 / 311 = 5.294\u00d710^6 mm^3 = 5.294\u00d710^\u22123 m^3.\n\nYield moment of a beam (\u03c3_y = 400 MPa = 400 N/mm^2):\nM_y = \u03c3_y Z = 400(5.294\u00d710^6) = 2.118\u00d710^9 N\u00b7mm = 2,117.5 kN\u00b7m.\n\nFor the top beam (most critical; downward Pj increases sagging):\nM_top = wL^2/8 + Pj L/4 \u2264 M_y.\n\nSolve for Pj,max:\nPj,max = [M_y \u2212 wL^2/8] (4/L)\n       = (2,117.5 \u2212 7.161) (4/5)\n       = 1,688 kN.\n\nCheck bottom beam (hogging at midspan):\nM_bottom = |wL^2/8 \u2212 Pj L/4| at Pj,max = |7.161 \u2212 2,110.4| = 2,103.2 kN\u00b7m < M_y, so OK.\n\nCable sizing\n- Each support reaction at this Pj,max:\nR = (wL + Pj,max)/2 = (11.458 + 1,688)/2 = 849.9 kN.\n- Five closed loops per end; each loop has two vertical legs (angles neglected), so\n  R = 10T \u21d2 T = R/10 = 84.99 kN tension in each cable leg (and in each closed loop).\n\nTo avoid yielding in the cables (take same 400 MPa yield):\nA_min = T/\u03c3_y = 84,990 N / (400 N/mm^2) = 212.5 mm^2.\nd_min = sqrt(4A_min/\u03c0) = sqrt(850/\u03c0) = 16.5 mm.\n\nAnswers (b)\n- Maximum allowable jack force without yielding any beam: Pj,max \u2248 1.688 MN.\n- Minimum cable diameter (for five closed loops per end): d_min \u2248 16.5 mm.\n\nQuestion 4c: Maximum flexural stress in each beam at Pj,max\n\n- Top beam:\nM_top = M_y \u2248 2,117.5 kN\u00b7m \u21d2 \u03c3_top,max = M_top/Z = 400 MPa (at midspan, bottom flange in tension).\n\n- Bottom beam:\nM_bottom = 2,103.2 kN\u00b7m \u21d2\n\u03c3_bottom,max = M_bottom/Z = (2,103.2/2,117.5)\u00d7400 = 397 MPa (at midspan, top flange in tension; hogging).\n\nSummary\na) BMD for top beam (L = 5 m, w = 2.292 kN/m, Pj = 22 kN): reactions 16.73 kN at each support; maximum sagging M = 34.66 kN\u00b7m at midspan.\nb) Pj,max = 1.688 MN to avoid beam yield; with five closed loops per end, minimum cable diameter d_min \u2248 16.5 mm to keep cable stress \u2264 400 MPa.\nc) At Pj,max: \u03c3_top,max \u2248 400 MPa; \u03c3_bottom,max \u2248 397 MPa.",
