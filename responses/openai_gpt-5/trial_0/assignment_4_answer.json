  "answer": "Question 5a: Reactions at the supports (whole-truss equilibrium)\n\nWhat is known/assumed from the figure:\n- The only support force at joint A is horizontal (Ax).\n- At joint R there is a pin with Rx and Ry.\n- All external loads are vertical and act at the lower-chord panel points S, T, U, V, W, X, Y and Z. The magnitudes shown on the figure are (kN): \n  S = 13,760; T = 11,910; U = 10,280; V = 8,220; W = 5,970; X = 3,970; Y = 3,540; Z = 22,100.\n- Panel-point abscissae measured from R (m) obtained from the panel lengths printed above the top chord:\n  S: 25.5; T: 51.0; U: 76.5; V: 102.0; W: 124.4; X: 143.3; Y: 157.6; Z: 177.3.\n- The vertical spacing between A and R is hAR = 93.26 m (left-hand dimension on the figure).\n\nResultant vertical load:\n\u03a3P = 13,760 + 11,910 + 10,280 + 8,220 + 5,970 + 3,970 + 3,540 + 22,100\n     = 79,750 kN.\n\nVertical reaction:\nOnly R can supply vertical reaction, hence\nRy = \u03a3P = 79,750 kN upward.\n\nMoment equilibrium about R (counterclockwise positive):\nThe vertical loads produce a clockwise moment about R equal to\n\nMdown = \u03a3(Pi xi) \n      = 13,760(25.5) + 11,910(51.0) + 10,280(76.5) + 8,220(102.0)\n        + 5,970(124.4) + 3,970(143.3) + 3,540(157.6) + 22,100(177.3)\n      = 8.371\u00d710^6 kN\u00b7m.\n\nThe only force that can balance that moment about R is Ax acting at A, a height hAR above R, which forms a pure couple with Rx. Taking moments about R:\n\nAx hAR \u2212 Mdown = 0  \u2192  Ax = Mdown / hAR\n               = 8.370953\u00d710^6 / 93.26\n               \u2248 89,760 kN.\n\nGlobal horizontal force equilibrium:\nRx + Ax = 0  \u2192  Rx = \u2212Ax \u2248 \u221289,760 kN.\n\nHence, with directions:\n- Ax = 89,760 kN acting to the left at joint A\n- Rx = 89,760 kN acting to the right at joint R\n- Ry = 79,750 kN acting upward at joint R\n\nThese three reactions equilibrate the truss.\n\nQuestion 5b: Forces in members AB and AJ (joint A)\n\nData available at A:\n- External reaction Ax = 89,760 kN (to the left).\n- Member AR is known to be in compression with magnitude FAR = 36,100 kN (given).\n- AB is horizontal.\n- AJ is a diagonal member from A down toward the inside joint J.\n- AR is vertical (A and R lie on the same vertical line).\n\nLet \u03b8AJ be the angle that member AJ makes with the horizontal (measured at A). From the figure, AJ slopes downward from A toward J; with the usual joint convention (tension positive, acting away from the joint), AJ must come out in compression for vertical equilibrium (because AR pushes downward on A when in compression).\n\nJoint A equilibrium:\n- Sum of vertical forces at A:\n  + AJ sin\u03b8AJ \u2212 FAR = 0\n  \u2192 FAJ = FAR / sin\u03b8AJ.\n\n- Sum of horizontal forces at A:\n  + FAB \u2212 Ax \u2212 FAJ cos\u03b8AJ = 0\n  \u2192 FAB = Ax + (FAR / sin\u03b8AJ) cos\u03b8AJ = Ax + FAR cot\u03b8AJ.\n\nIf the angle read from your drawing for AJ is used (\u03b8AJ \u2248 57.8\u00b0 from the construction in the figure), then:\n\nFAJ = 36,100 / sin57.8\u00b0 \u2248 42,700 kN (compression),\nFAB = 89,760 + 36,100 cot57.8\u00b0 \u2248 112,000 kN (tension).\n\nState clearly in your write\u2011up the angle you read from your figure for AJ; the expressions above are exact and can be evaluated with the actual \u03b8AJ if your copy of the figure provides a slightly different angle.\n\nQuestion 5c: Forces in members RS and RJ (joint R)\n\nKnown at R:\n- Rx = +89,760 kN (to the right),\n- Ry = +79,750 kN (upward),\n- Member AR is in compression, therefore the force AR acting on joint R is upward with magnitude FAR = 36,100 kN,\n- RS is horizontal,\n- RJ is a diagonal from R toward the inside joint J; let its angle with the horizontal be \u03b8RJ (read from the figure).\n\nJoint R equilibrium:\n- Vertical:\n  Ry + FAR + FRJ sin\u03b8RJ = 0  \u2192  FRJ = \u2212(Ry + FAR)/sin\u03b8RJ.\n  Numerically: FRJ = \u2212(79,750 + 36,100)/sin\u03b8RJ = \u2212115,850/sin\u03b8RJ kN.\n  The negative sign confirms RJ is in compression (force on the joint acts downward).\n\n- Horizontal:\n  Rx + FRS + FRJ cos\u03b8RJ = 0\n  \u2192 FRS = \u2212Rx \u2212 FRJ cos\u03b8RJ\n        = \u2212Rx + (Ry + FAR) cot\u03b8RJ.\n\nUsing \u03b8RJ read from your figure gives the numerical values. For example, if \u03b8RJ \u2248 58\u00b0 (typical for the first K-panel), then\n  FRJ \u2248 \u2212115,850/sin58\u00b0 \u2248 \u2212136,800 kN (compression),\n  FRS \u2248 \u221289,760 + 115,850 cot58\u00b0 \u2248 \u221219,700 kN,\nso RS would be about 19,700 kN in compression (acting to the left on joint R). Replace 58\u00b0 by the angle you read from your sheet to obtain your final numbers.\n\nQuestion 5d: Forces in IZ, ZY, IH, IQ, QY, QH, HP and HG\n\nStrategy (what to cut and in what order):\n- Work from the free end, where only the tip load (joint Z) and the near-tip panel load (joint Y) act.\n- Use the fact (stated on the sheet) that lines that appear horizontal/vertical are exactly horizontal/vertical. Thus ZY and HG, IH are horizontal, and QH and HP are vertical.\n- Use joint-by-joint or short sections so that at each step you have only two unknown member forces and you can avoid solving large systems:\n  1) Start with joint Z (members: IZ, ZY). With the 22,100 kN vertical load at Z and only two members meeting, you can solve IZ and ZY immediately because ZY is horizontal.\n  2) Move to joint Y (members: ZY, QY, QH, XY if present). With ZY known from the previous step and the applied load at Y (3,540 kN), solve for QY and QH (QH vertical).\n  3) Go to joint Q (members: IQ, QY, QH, HP). With QY and QH known, solve IQ and HP (HP vertical).\n  4) Joint I (members: IZ, IH, IQ). IZ already known, so you can solve IH and IQ consistently.\n  5) Joint H (members: HG, IH, HP, QH). With IH, QH and HP known, solve for the top-chord force HG.\n\nEquations you will use at each joint (write them exactly as you evaluate them with the angles read from your figure):\n\n- Joint Z:\n  \u03a3Fy: FIZ sin\u03b8IZ + 0 \u2212 22,100 = 0\n  \u03a3Fx: FZY + FIZ cos\u03b8IZ = 0\n  \u2192 FIZ = 22,100/sin\u03b8IZ (sign tells tension/compression),\n     FZY = \u2212FIZ cos\u03b8IZ.\n\n- Joint Y:\n  \u03a3Fy: +FQY sin\u03b8QY + FQH \u2212 3,540 = 0\n  \u03a3Fx: \u2212FZY + FQY cos\u03b8QY = 0\n  \u2192 Solve for FQY and FQH (QH is vertical).\n\n- Joint Q:\n  \u03a3Fy: \u2212FQH + FIQ sin\u03b8IQ + FHP = 0\n  \u03a3Fx: \u2212FIQ cos\u03b8IQ \u2212 FQY cos\u03b8QY = 0\n  \u2192 Solve for FIQ and FHP.\n\n- Joint I:\n  \u03a3Fy: \u2212FIZ sin\u03b8IZ \u2212 FIQ sin\u03b8IQ + 0 = 0\n  \u03a3Fx: FIH \u2212 FIZ cos\u03b8IZ \u2212 FIQ cos\u03b8IQ = 0\n  \u2192 Solve for FIH (horizontal) and check consistency of FIQ from the previous step.\n\n- Joint H:\n  \u03a3Fy: \u2212FHP + 0 + FQH + 0 = 0 (this is a check; it should be satisfied by the values from the Q joint)\n  \u03a3Fx: FHG \u2212 FIH = 0 \u2192 FHG = FIH.\n\nNumerical evaluation\nBecause the provided scan is too low in resolution to read the necessary panel-point angles for IZ and IQ (small angle markings are present near the right-hand panels but are not legible in the image), I cannot safely read \u03b8IZ and \u03b8IQ from the figure. The steps above give you a two\u2011equation system at each joint; once \u03b8IZ and \u03b8IQ (and \u03b8QY, if QY is not at a standard 45\u00b0) are read from your copy, plug them into the equations directly to get the numbers. Note that:\n- ZY, IH, and HG are horizontal (no vertical components).\n- QH and HP are vertical (no horizontal components).\n\nSummary of obtained numerical results (with angles as indicated in the text):\n- Reactions:\n  Ax = 89,760 kN (to the left at A)\n  Rx = 89,760 kN (to the right at R)\n  Ry = 79,750 kN (upward at R)\n\n- Member forces from joint A (using \u03b8AJ \u2248 57.8\u00b0; replace with your actual value if different):\n  AJ \u2248 42,700 kN in compression,\n  AB \u2248 112,000 kN in tension.\n\n- Members at joint R (using \u03b8RJ as read from your figure; numerics shown for \u03b8RJ \u2248 58\u00b0):\n  RJ \u2248 136,800 kN in compression,\n  RS \u2248 19,700 kN in compression.\n  Replace 58\u00b0 by the angle read from your print to obtain your final numbers.\n\n- Right-end members IZ, ZY, IH, IQ, QY, QH, HP, HG:\n  Use the step-by-step joint equations above with the diagonal angles taken from your figure. Each step is statically determinate with two unknowns and can be evaluated directly.\n\nIf you can supply (or re-scan) the small angle values printed beside the right-hand diagonals (e.g., \u03b8IZ, \u03b8IQ, and \u03b8QY) I will finish the arithmetic and provide the eight final member forces to the nearest kN.",
