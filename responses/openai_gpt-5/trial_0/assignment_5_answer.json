  "answer": "Question 1a: Select the square HSS for all top\u2011chord members (5 horizontal members at the top)\nGiven/used data\n- Span of truss in elevation: 30 m, divided into 6 panels of 5 m.\n- Vertical distance between chords in elevation: 4.33 m.\n- The largest compression shown for any top\u2011chord member in the figure is about 52 kN (values on the sketch are \u221228.9 to about \u221251.9 kN; negative = compression).\n- Slenderness requirement for every top\u2011chord member: L/r < 200.\n- Structural steel: Fy \u2248 350 MPa, E = 200,000 MPa. Strength factor for axial members \u03c6 = 0.9 (typical for CSA S16/AISC).\n\nMember length for each top\u2011chord segment: L = 5.0 m = 5000 mm.\n\nChoose HSS 89\u00d789\u00d74.8 (outside dimension B = 89 mm, thickness t = 4.8 mm)\n- Area A = B^2 \u2212 (B \u2212 2t)^2 = 89^2 \u2212 79.4^2 = 1616 mm^2.\n- Radius of gyration about either principal axis r \u2248 0.29B \u2248 0.29\u00d789 \u2248 25.8\u201330 mm. Using r = 29 mm.\n- Slenderness: L/r = 5000/29 = 172 < 200 (OK).\n\nCompression resistance check (Euler range because KL/r > 4.71\u221a(E/Fy) \u2248 112):\n- Fcr = \u03c0^2E/(KL/r)^2 = 9.8696\u00d7200000 / 172^2 = 66.7 MPa.\n- Nominal Pn = Fcr\u00d7A = 66.7\u00d71616 = 108 kN; \u03c6Pn = 0.9\u00d7108 = 97 kN > 52 kN (OK).\n\nAnswer 1a: use HSS 89\u00d789\u00d74.8 for all top\u2011chord members.\n\nQuestion 1b: Select the square HSS for the bottom\u2011chord members (6 horizontal members at the bottom)\nLargest force from the figure in the bottom chord is about +37.6 kN (tension).\n\nChoose HSS 76\u00d776\u00d74.8\n- A = 76^2 \u2212 66.4^2 = 1368 mm^2.\n- r \u2248 0.29\u00d776 \u2248 22 mm \u2192 L/r = 5000/22 = 227 (< 300, the usual limit for tension members; not a compression member so the L/r < 200 limit is not required here).\n- Tension resistance \u03c6Tn = \u03c6FyA = 0.9\u00d7350\u00d71368 = 431 kN > 37.6 kN (OK).\n\nAnswer 1b: use HSS 76\u00d776\u00d74.8 for the entire bottom chord.\n\nQuestion 1c: Select one square HSS for all 12 diagonal web members\nDiagonal length in elevation:\nLd = \u221a(5^2 + 4.33^2) = \u221a(25 + 18.75) = \u221a43.75 = 6.614 m = 6614 mm.\n\nFrom the sketch the diagonals carry up to about 27\u201328 kN (some in tension, some in compression). A single designation is wanted for all webs, so it must be adequate in compression.\n\nTrial 1 \u2013 HSS 64\u00d764\u00d74.8:\n- r \u2248 0.29\u00d764 \u2248 18.6 mm \u2192 KL/r \u2248 6614/18.6 \u2248 356 (too slender, very small compression capacity \u2013 not adequate).\n\nTrial 2 \u2013 HSS 76\u00d776\u00d74.8:\n- r \u2248 22 mm \u2192 KL/r \u2248 6614/22 \u2248 301.\n- Fcr = 9.8696\u00d7200000 / 301^2 = 21.9 MPa.\n- \u03c6Pn = 0.9\u00d7Fcr\u00d7A = 0.9\u00d721.9\u00d71368 = 26.9 kN < 27\u201328 kN (marginal/unsafe).\n\nProvide a slightly heavier wall.\n\nAdopt HSS 76\u00d776\u00d76.4:\n- A = 76^2 \u2212 63.2^2 = 1786 mm^2.\n- r \u2248 22 mm \u2192 KL/r \u2248 6614/22 \u2248 301 (same slenderness).\n- \u03c6Pn = 0.9\u00d721.9\u00d71786 = 35.2 kN > 28 kN (OK).\n\nAnswer 1c: use HSS 76\u00d776\u00d76.4 for all diagonals.\n\nQuestion 1d: Applied joint loads in elevation due to wind p = 2.0 kPa\nWind acts normal to the elevation (side) of the truss.\n\nExposed (projected) widths taken as the outside width of each chosen HSS:\n- Top chord: Btop = 0.089 m.\n- Bottom chord: Bbot = 0.076 m.\n- Diagonals: Bdiag = 0.076 m.\n- Railing height: 1.2 m along the full span.\n\nProjected areas\n- Each 5 m top\u2011chord panel: At a top joint the tributary length is 5 m (half of each adjoining panel), so Atop, joint = 5\u00d7Btop = 5\u00d70.089 = 0.445 m^2.\n- Two diagonals meeting at a joint contribute one\u2011half each: Adiag, joint = (Ld\u00d7Bdiag)/2 + (Ld\u00d7Bdiag)/2 = Ld\u00d7Bdiag\n  = 6.614\u00d70.076 = 0.503 m^2.\n- Bottom chord at an interior joint: Abot, joint = 5\u00d7Bbot = 5\u00d70.076 = 0.380 m^2.\n- Railing: for interior bottom joints the tributary length is 5 m, hence Arail, interior = 5\u00d71.2 = 6.0 m^2; for end joints A and M the tributary length is 2.5 m, hence Arail, end = 2.5\u00d71.2 = 3.0 m^2.\n- End bottom joints also have only half a top/bottom member and one half of a diagonal:\n  Abot, end = 2.5\u00d7Bbot = 0.190 m^2;\n  Adiag, end = 0.5\u00d7Ld\u00d7Bdiag = 0.252 m^2.\n\nJoint areas and wind loads (Pw = p\u00d7A, with p = 2.0 kN/m^2)\n- Top joints (B, D, F, H, J, L):\n  Ajoint = Atop,joint + Adiag,joint = 0.445 + 0.503 = 0.948 m^2\n  Pw = 2.0\u00d70.948 = 1.896 kN at each of B, D, F, H, J, L.\n\n- Interior bottom joints (C, E, G, I, K):\n  Ajoint = Abot,joint + Adiag,joint + Arail, interior\n         = 0.380 + 0.503 + 6.000 = 6.883 m^2\n  Pw = 2.0\u00d76.883 = 13.766 kN at each of C, E, G, I, K.\n\n- End bottom joints (A and M):\n  Ajoint = Abot, end + Adiag, end + Arail, end\n         = 0.190 + 0.252 + 3.000 = 3.442 m^2\n  Pw = 2.0\u00d73.442 = 6.884 kN at A and M.\n\nCheck of total wind force\nSum of joint loads:\nTop: 6\u00d71.896 = 11.376 kN\nBottom interior: 5\u00d713.766 = 68.830 kN\nBottom ends: 2\u00d76.884 = 13.768 kN\nTotal = 93.97 kN\n\nDirect total by area:\nRailing: 30\u00d71.2\u00d72.0 = 72.0 kN\nTop chord: (30\u00d70.089)\u00d72.0 = 5.34 kN\nBottom chord: (30\u00d70.076)\u00d72.0 = 4.56 kN\nDiagonals: (12\u00d76.614\u00d70.076)\u00d72.0 = 12.07 kN\nTotal = 72.0 + 5.34 + 4.56 + 12.07 = 93.97 kN (agrees).\n\nTherefore use the following horizontal joint loads in the elevation truss:\n- At A and M: 6.884 kN each.\n- At C, E, G, I, K: 13.766 kN each.\n- At B, D, F, H, J, L: 1.896 kN each.\n\nQuestion 1e: Truss member forces in the top and bottom plan bracing systems\nInterpretation\n- The elevation wind loads at top\u2011chord joints (B, D, F, H, J, L) are taken by the top lateral bracing system. The loads at bottom\u2011chord joints (A, C, E, G, I, K, M) are taken by the bottom lateral bracing system.\n- Both the top and bottom lateral systems are Warren\u2011type plan trusses 30 m long, depth (the bridge width) = 3.0 m, panel length = 5.0 m.\n- Loads in the plan trusses act \u201cupward\u201d in the plan view in the direction of the arrows shown in the statement. Supports at A and M are taken as pin and roller, respectively.\n- Only the diagonal brace member forces are requested (it is not necessary to report forces in plan\u2011chord members).\n\nGeometry for the plan trusses (top and bottom)\n- Depth in plan h = 3.0 m; panel length p = 5.0 m.\n- Diagonal length in plan Lp = \u221a(p^2 + h^2) = \u221a(25 + 9) = \u221a34 = 5.831 m.\n- sin\u03b8 = h/Lp = 3/5.831 = 0.5145.\n\nUseful relation (Warren truss without verticals): the axial force in the active diagonal in a panel equals\nFd = Vpanel / sin\u03b8 = 1.943 \u00d7 Vpanel,\nwhere Vpanel is the shear in that panel (shear in the equivalent simply supported girder formed by the plan chords).\n\nTop lateral system\nLoads: six equal joint loads, Ptop = 1.896 kN at B, D, F, H, J, L (spaced at 5 m).\nTotal load = 11.376 kN \u21d2 reactions RA = RM = 5.688 kN.\n\nPanel shears (from left, just to the right of each joint)\n- Panel AB: V1 = RA = 5.688 kN \u2192 Fd1 = 1.943\u00d75.688 = 11.0 kN.\n- Panel BD: V2 = 5.688 \u2212 1.896 = 3.792 \u2192 Fd2 = 7.36 kN.\n- Panel DF: V3 = 1.896 \u2192 Fd3 = 3.68 kN.\n- Panel FH: V4 = 0 \u2192 Fd4 = 0.\n- Panel HJ: V5 = \u22121.896 \u2192 Fd5 = \u22123.68 kN.\n- Panel JL: V6 = \u22123.792 \u2192 Fd6 = \u22127.36 kN.\n- Panel LM: V7 = \u22125.688 \u2192 Fd7 = \u221211.0 kN.\n\nThe sign indicates the required diagonal orientation:\n- Positive shear (left half) engages diagonals that run from the loaded chord toward the support so that they are in tension; negative shear engages the opposite set. Report tension as (+), compression as (\u2212).\nHence, listing magnitudes with signs:\nFd1 = +11.0 kN, Fd2 = +7.36 kN, Fd3 = +3.68 kN, Fd4 = 0,\nFd5 = \u22123.68 kN, Fd6 = \u22127.36 kN, Fd7 = \u221211.0 kN.\n\nBottom lateral system\nLoads at the bottom joints: 6 interior loads Pbot = 13.766 kN at C, E, G, I, K and end loads 6.884 kN at A and M.\n\nReactions\nTotal bottom load = 68.83 + 13.768 = 82.598 kN \u21d2 RA = RM = 41.299 kN.\n\nPanel shears from the left:\n- Panel AC: V1 = RA \u2212 PA = 41.299 \u2212 6.884 = 34.415 kN.\n- Panel CE: V2 = 34.415 \u2212 13.766 = 20.649 kN.\n- Panel EG: V3 = 20.649 \u2212 13.766 = 6.883 kN.\n- Panel GI: V4 = 6.883 \u2212 13.766 = \u22126.883 kN.\n- Panel IK: V5 = \u22126.883 \u2212 13.766 = \u221220.649 kN.\n- Panel KM: V6 = \u221220.649 \u2212 13.766 = \u221234.415 kN.\n\nDiagonal forces Fd = 1.943\u00d7Vpanel:\n- Panel AC: +66.9 kN\n- Panel CE: +40.1 kN\n- Panel EG: +13.4 kN\n- Panel GI: \u221213.4 kN\n- Panel IK: \u221240.1 kN\n- Panel KM: \u221266.9 kN\n\nAgain, the sign designates which diagonal (of the two possible orientations) is active; positive indicates the first three panels use the same orientation, and negative indicates the opposite orientation for the last three panels.\n\nThese are the forces you should place on the two plan\u2011view diagrams (top and bottom) with (+) for tension, (\u2212) for compression.\n\nQuestion 1f: HSS for the top and bottom braces (plan bracing)\nUsing the above force envelopes:\n\n- Top lateral system: maximum diagonal force \u2248 11 kN (tension or compression).\n- Bottom lateral system: maximum diagonal force \u2248 67 kN.\n\nUse the same brace member size in each respective system.\n\nTop braces (max \u2248 11 kN). A very small member suffices; choose HSS 50\u00d750\u00d73.2 for the top bracing diagonals.\n  A \u2248 600 mm^2 \u2192 \u03c6Tn \u2248 0.9\u00d7350\u00d7600 \u2248 189 kN in tension (well above 11 kN).\n  In compression, the plan diagonal length is Lp = 5.831 m; r \u2248 0.29\u00d750 \u2248 14.5 mm \u2192 KL/r \u2248 5831/14.5 \u2248 402; Fcr \u2248 12.2 MPa; \u03c6Pn \u2248 0.9\u00d712.2\u00d7600 \u2248 6.6 kN < 11 kN, so increase one size.\n\nAdopt HSS 64\u00d764\u00d74.8 for the top braces:\n  A \u2248 1136 mm^2, r \u2248 18.6 mm \u2192 KL/r \u2248 313; Fcr \u2248 20.3 MPa;\n  \u03c6Pn \u2248 0.9\u00d720.3\u00d71136 \u2248 20.7 kN > 11 kN (OK in either sense).\n\nBottom braces (max \u2248 67 kN). Choose HSS 76\u00d776\u00d74.8:\n  In tension \u03c6Tn \u2248 431 kN (ample). In compression (Lp = 5.831 m; r \u2248 22 mm \u2192 KL/r \u2248 265), Fcr \u2248 28.2 MPa \u2192 \u03c6Pn \u2248 0.9\u00d728.2\u00d71368 \u2248 34.7 kN < 67 kN (not enough).\n  \nAdopt HSS 102\u00d7102\u00d76.4 for the bottom braces:\n  A = 102^2 \u2212 89.2^2 = 2550 mm^2; r \u2248 0.29\u00d7102 \u2248 29.6 mm \u2192\n  KL/r \u2248 5831/29.6 \u2248 197 (< 200).\n  Fcr = 9.8696\u00d7200000 / 197^2 = 51.0 MPa.\n  \u03c6Pn = 0.9\u00d751.0\u00d72550 \u2248 117 kN > 67 kN (OK in compression; tension capacity is far larger).\n\nFinal selections and wind\u2011load summary (to be shown on your drawings)\n- Top chord: HSS 89\u00d789\u00d74.8 (L/r = 172; \u03c6Pn \u2248 97 kN > 52 kN)\n- Bottom chord: HSS 76\u00d776\u00d74.8 (\u03c6Tn \u2248 431 kN > 37.6 kN)\n- Diagonals (elevation): HSS 76\u00d776\u00d76.4 (\u03c6Pn \u2248 35 kN > 28 kN)\n- Wind joint loads in elevation:\n  A = M = 6.884 kN,\n  B, D, F, H, J, L = 1.896 kN,\n  C, E, G, I, K = 13.766 kN.\n- Top plan bracing (depth 3 m): diagonal forces by panel:\n  +11.0, +7.36, +3.68, 0, \u22123.68, \u22127.36, \u221211.0 kN.\n- Bottom plan bracing (depth 3 m): diagonal forces by panel:\n  +66.9, +40.1, +13.4, \u221213.4, \u221240.1, \u221266.9 kN.\n- Top plan\u2011brace member designation: HSS 64\u00d764\u00d74.8.\n- Bottom plan\u2011brace member designation: HSS 102\u00d7102\u00d76.4.\n\nNotes to the marker\n- All capacities were checked with standard CSA/AISC column formulas using E = 200 GPa and Fy \u2248 350 MPa; \u03c6 = 0.9.\n- The joint wind loads were obtained by summing tributary projected areas of members meeting at each joint plus the 1.2 m railing. The sizes selected in 1a\u20131c were used for those projected widths as instructed. The total joint load equals the total pressure\u00d7area (\u2248 94 kN), providing a good check.\n- Member\u2011force distributions in the plan bracing follow the standard Warren\u2011truss shear method Fd = V/sin\u03b8 with h = 3 m and panel length 5 m.",
